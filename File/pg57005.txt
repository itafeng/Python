                                   OF
                           Captain _MISSON_.

We can be somewhat particular in the Life of this Gentleman, because, by
very great Accident, we have got into our Hands a _French_ Manuscript,
in which he himself gives a Detail of his Actions. He was born in
_Provence_, of an ancient Family; his Father, whose true Name he
conceals, was Master of a plentiful Fortune; but having a great Number
of Children, our Rover had but little Hopes of other Fortune than what
he could carve out for himself with his Sword. His Parents took Care to
give him an Education equal to his Birth. After he had passed his
Humanity and Logick, and was a tolerable Mathematician, at the Age of
Fifteen he was sent to _Angiers_, where he was a Year learning his
Exercises. His Father, at his Return home, would have put him into the
Musketeers; but as he was of a roving Temper, and much affected with the
Accounts he had read in Books of Travels, he chose the Sea as a Life
which abounds with more Variety, and would afford him an Opportunity to
gratify his Curiosity, by the Change of Countries. Having made this
Choice, his Father, with Letters of Recommendation, and every Thing
fitting for him, sent him Voluntier on board the _Victoire_, commanded
by Monsieur _Fourbin_, his Relation. He was received on Board with all
possible Regard by the Captain, whose Ship was at _Marseilles_, and was
order'd to cruize soon after _Misson_'s Arrival. Nothing could be more
agreeable to the Inclinations of our Voluntier than this Cruize, which
made him acquainted with the most noted Ports of the _Mediterranean_,
and gave him a great Insight into the practical Part of Navigation. He
grew fond of this Life, and was resolved to be a compleat Sailor, which
made him always one of the first on a Yard Arm, either to Hand or Reef,
and very inquisitive in the different Methods of working a Ship: His
Discourse was turn'd on no other Subject, and he would often get the
Boatswain and Carpenter to teach him in their Cabbins the constituent
Parts of a Ship's Hull, and how to rigg her, which he generously paid
'em for; and tho' he spent a great Part of his Time with these two
Officers, yet he behaved himself with such Prudence that they never
attempted at a Familiarity, and always paid the Respect due to his
Family. The Ship being at _Naples_, he obtained Leave of his Captain to
go to _Rome_, which he had a great Desire to visit. Hence we may date
his Misfortunes; for, remarking the licentious Lives of the Clergy (so
different from the Regularity observ'd among the _French_
Ecclesiasticks,) the Luxury of the Papal Court, and that nothing but
Hulls of Religion was to be found in the Metropolis of the Christian
Church, he began to figure to himself that all Religion was no more than
a Curb upon the Minds of the Weaker, which the wiser Sort yielded to, in
Appearance only. These Sentiments, so disadvantageous to Religion and
himself, were strongly riveted by accidentally becoming acquainted with
a lewd Priest, who was, at his Arrival (by meer Chance) his Confessor,
and after that his Procurer and Companion, for he kept him Company to
his Death. One Day, having an Opportunity, he told _Misson_, a Religious
was a very good Life, where a Man had a subtle enterprising Genius, and
some Friends; for such a one wou'd, in a short Time, rise to such
Dignities in the Church, the Hopes of which was the Motive of all the
wiser Sort, who voluntarily took upon them the sacerdotal Habit. That
the ecclesiastical State was govern'd with the same Policy as were
secular Principalities and Kingdoms; that what was beneficial, not what
was meritorious and virtuous, would be alone regarded. That there were
no more Hopes for a Man of Piety and Learning in the Patrimony of St.
_Peter_, than in any other Monarchy, nay, rather less; for this being
known to be real, that Man's rejected as a Visionary, no way fit for
Employment; as one whose Scruples might prove prejudicial; for its a
Maxim, that Religion and Politicks can never set up in one House. As to
our Statesmen, don't imagine that the Purple makes 'em less Courtiers
than are those of other Nations; they know and pursue the _Reggione del
Stato_ (a Term of Art which means Self-Interest) with as much Cunning
and as little Conscience as any Secular; and are as artful where Art is
required, and as barefaced and impudent when their Power is great enough
to support 'em, in the oppressing the People, and aggrandizing their
Families. What their Morals are, you may read in the Practice of their
Lives, and their Sentiments of Religion from this Saying of a certain
Cardinal, _Quantum Lucrum ex ista fabula Christi!_ which many of 'em may
say, tho' they are not so foolish. For my Part, I am quite tir'd of the
Farce, and will lay hold on the first Opportunity to throw off this
masquerading Habit; for, by Reason of my Age, I must act an under Part
many Years; and before I can rise to share the Spoils of the People, I
shall, I fear, be too old to enjoy the Sweets of Luxury; and, as I am an
Enemy to Restraint, I am apprehensive I shall never act up to my
Character, and carry thro' the Hypocrite with Art enough to rise to any
considerable Post in the Church. My Parents did not consult my Genius,
or they would have given me a Sword instead of a Pair of Beads.

_Misson_ advised him to go with him Voluntier, and offer'd him Money to
cloath him; the Priest leap'd at the Proposal, and a Letter coming to
_Misson_ from his Captain, that he was going to _Leghorn_, and left to
him either to come to _Naples_, or go by Land; he chose the latter, and
the _Dominican_, whom he furnish'd with Money, clothing himself very
Cavalierly, threw off his Habit, and preceeded him two Days, staying at
_Pisa_ for _Misson_; from whence they went together to _Leghorn_, where
they found the _Victoire_, and Signor _Caraccioli_, recommended by his
Friend, was received on Board. Two Days after they weigh'd from hence,
and after a Week's Cruize fell in with two _Sally_ Men, the one of
twenty, the other of twenty four Guns; the _Victoire_ had but thirty
mounted, though she had Ports for forty. The Engagement was long and
bloody, for the _Sally_ Man hop'd to carry the _Victoire_; and, on the
contrary, Captain _Fourbin_, so far from having any Thoughts of being
taken, he was resolutely bent to make Prize of his Enemies, or sink his
Ship. One of the _Sally_ Men was commanded by a _Spanish_ Renegade,
(though he had only the Title of a Lieutenant) for the Captain was a
young Man who knew little of Marine Affairs.

This Ship was called the _Lyon_; and he attempted, more than once, to
board the _Victoire_; but by a Shot betwixt Wind and Water, he was
obliged to sheer off, and running his Guns, _&c._ on one Side, bring her
on the careen to stop his Leak; this being done with too much
Precipitation, she overset, and every Soul was lost: His Comrade seeing
this Disaster, threw out all his small Sails, and endeavour'd to get
off, but the _Victoire_ wrong'd her, and oblig'd her to renew the Fight,
which she did with great Obstinacy, and made Monsieur _Fourbin_ despair
of carrying her if he did not board; he made Preparations accordingly.
Signior _Caraccioli_ and _Misson_ were the two first on board when the
Command was given; but they and their Followers were beat back by the
Despair of the _Sally_ Men; the former received a Shot in his Thigh, and
was carried down to the Surgeon. The _Victoire_ laid her on board the
second time, and the _Sally_ Men defended their Decks with such
Resolution, that they were cover'd with their own, and the dead Bodies
of their Enemies. _Misson_ seeing one of 'em jump down the Main-Hatch
with a lighted Match, suspecting his Design, resolutely leap'd after
him, and reaching him with his Sabre, laid him dead the Moment he was
going to set Fire to the Powder. The _Victoire_ pouring in more Men, the
_Mahometans_ quitted the Decks, finding Resistance vain, and fled for
Shelter to the Cook Room, Steerage and Cabbins, and some run between
Decks. The _French_ gave 'em Quarters, and put the Prisoners on board
the _Victoire_, the Prize yielding nothing worth mention, except Liberty
to about fifteen Christian Slaves; she was carried into and sold with
the Prisoners at _Leghorn_. The _Turks_ lost a great many Men, the
_French_ not less than 35 in boarding, for they lost very few by the
great Shot, the _Sally_ Men firing mostly at the Masts and Rigging,
hoping by disabling to carry her. The limited Time of their Cruize being
out, the _Victoire_ returned to _Marseilles_, from whence _Misson_,
taking his Companion, went to visit his Parents, to whom the Captain
sent a very advantageous Character, both of his Courage and Conduct. He
was about a Month at home when his Captain wrote to him, that his Ship
was order'd to _Rochelle_, from whence he was to sail for the
_West-Indies_ with some Merchant Men. This was very agreeable to
_Misson_ and Signior _Caraccioli_, who immediately set out for
_Marseilles_. This Town is well fortified, has four Parish Churches, and
the Number of Inhabitants is computed to be about 120,000; the Harbour
is esteemed the safest in the _Mediterranean_, and is the common Station
for the _French_ Gallies.

Leaving this Place, they steer'd for _Rochelle_, where the _Victoire_
was dock'd, the Merchant Ships not being near ready. _Misson_, who did
not care to pass so long a Time in Idleness, proposed to his Comrade the
taking a Cruize on board the _Triumph_, who was going into the _English_
Channel; the _Italian_ readily consented to it.

Between the Isle of _Guernsey_ and the _Start Point_, they met with the
_Mayflower_, Captain _Balladine_ Commanded, a Merchant Ship of 18 Guns,
richly laden, and coming from _Jamaica_. The Captain of the _English_
made a gallant Resistance, and fought his Ship so long, that the
_French_ could not carry her into Harbour, wherefore they took the
Money, and what was most valuable, out of her; and finding she made more
Water than the Pumps could free, quitted, and saw her go down in less
than four Hours after. Monsieur _le Blanc_, the _French_ Captain,
received Captain _Balladine_ very civilly, and would not suffer either
him or his Men to be stripp'd, saying, None but Cowards ought to be
treated after that Manner; that brave Men ought to treat such, though
their Enemies, as Brothers; and that to use a gallant Man (who does his
Duty) ill, speaks a Revenge which cannot proceed but from a Coward Soul.
He order'd that the Prisoners should have their Chests; and when some of
his Men seem'd to mutter, he bid 'em remember the Grandeur of the
Monarch they serv'd; that they were neither Pyrates nor Privateers; and,
as brave Men, they ought to shew their Enemies an Example they would
willingly have follow'd, and use their Prisoners as they wish'd to be
us'd.

They running up the _English_ Channel as high as _Beachy Head_, and, in
returning, fell in with three fifty Gun Ships, which gave Chace to the
_Triumph_; but as she was an excellent Sailor, she run 'em out of Sight
in seven Glasses, and made the best of her Way for the _Lands-End_; they
here cruized eight Days, then doubling Cape _Cornwall_, ran up the
_Bristol_ Channel, near as far as _Nash Point_, and intercepted a small
Ship from _Barbadoes_, and stretching away to the Northward, gave Chase
to a Ship they saw in the Evening, but lost her in the Night. The
_Triumph_ stood then towards _Milford_, and spying a Sail, endeavour'd
to cut her off the Land, but found it impossible; for she got into the
Haven, though they came up with her very fast, and she had surely been
taken, had the Chase had been any thing longer.

Captain _Balladine_, who took the Glass, said it was the _Port Royal_, a
_Bristol_ Ship which left _Jamaica_ in Company with him and the
_Charles_. They now return'd to their own Coast, and sold their Prize at
_Brest_, where, at his Desire, they left Captain _Balladine_, and
Monsieur _le Blanc_ made him a Present of Purse with 40 _Louis_'s for
his Support; his Crew were also left here.

At the Entrance into this Harbour the _Triumph_ struck upon a Rock, but
received no Damage: This Entrance, called _Gonlet_, is very dangerous on
Account of the Number of Rocks which lie on each Side under Water,
though the Harbour is certainly the best in _France_. The Mouth of the
Harbour is defended by a strong Castle; the Town is well fortified, and
has a Citadel for its farther Defence, which is of considerable
Strength. In 1694 the _English_ attempted a Descent, but did not find
their Market, for they were beat off with the Loss of their General, and
a great many Men. From hence the _Triumph_ return'd to _Rochel_, and in
a Month after our Voluntiers, who went on board the _Victoire_, took
their Departure for _Martineco_ and _Guadalupa_; they met with nothing
in their Voyage thither worth noting.

I shall only observe, that Signior _Caraccioli_, who was as ambitious as
he was irreligious, had, by this Time, made a perfect Deist of _Misson_,
and thereby convinc'd him, that all Religion was no other than human
Policy, and shew'd him that the Law of _Moses_ was no more than what
were necessary, as well for the Preservation as the Governing of the
People; for Instance, said he, the _African_ Negroes never heard of the
Institution of Circumcision, which is said to be the Sign of the
Covenant made between God and this People, and yet they circumcise their
Children; doubtless for the same Reason the _Jews_ and other Nations do,
who inhabit the Southern Climes, the Prepuce consolidating the perspired
Matter, which is of a fatal Consequence. In short, he ran through all
the Ceremonies of the _Jewish_, Christian and _Mahometan_ Religion, and
convinced him these were, as might be observed by the Absurdity of many,
far from being Institutions of Men inspired; and that _Moses_, in his
Account of the Creation, was guilty of known Blunders; and the Miracles,
both in the New and Old Testament, inconsistent with Reason. That God
had given us this Blessing, to make Use of for our present and future
Happiness, and whatever was contrary to it, notwithstanding their School
Distinctions of _contrary_ and _above_ Reason, must be false. This
Reason teaches us, that there is a first Cause of all Things, an _Ens
Entium_, which we call God, and our Reason will also suggest, that he
must be eternal, and, as the Author of every Thing perfect, he must be
infinitely perfect.

If so, he can be subject to no Passions, and neither loves nor hates; he
must be ever the same, and cannot rashly do to Day what he shall repent
to Morrow. He must be perfectly happy, consequently nothing can add to
an eternal State of Tranquillity, and though it becomes us to adore him,
yet can our Adorations neither augment, nor our Sins take from this
Happiness.

But his Arguments on this Head are too long, and too dangerous to
translate; and as they are work'd up with great Subtlety, they may be
pernicious to weak Men, who cannot discover their Fallacy; or, who
finding 'em agreeable to their Inclinations, and would be glad to shake
off the Yoke of the Christian Religion, which galls and curbs their
Passions, would not give themselves the Trouble to examine them to the
Bottom, but give into what pleases, glad of finding some Excuse to their
Consciences. Though as his Opinion of a future State has nothing in it
which impugns the Christian Religion, I shall set it down in few Words.

'That reasoning Faculty, says he, which we perceive within us, we call
the Soul, but what that Soul is, is unknown to us. It may die with the
Body, or it may survive. I am of Opinion its immortal; but to say that
this Opinion is the Dictate of Reason, or only the Prejudice of
Education, would, I own, puzzle me. If it is immortal, it must be an
Emanation from the Divine Being, and consequently at its being separated
from the Body, will return to its first Principle, if not contaminated.
Now, my Reason tells me, if it is estranged from its first Principle,
which is the Deity, all the Hells of Man's Invention can never yield
Tortures adequate to such a Banishment.'

As he had privately held these Discourses among the Crew, he had gained
a Number of Proselytes, who look'd upon him as a new Prophet risen up to
reform the Abuses in Religion; and a great Number being _Rochellers_,
and, as yet, tainted with _Calvanism_, his Doctrine was the more readily
embrac'd. When he had experienced the Effects of his religious
Arguments, he fell upon Government, and shew'd, that every Man was born
free, and had as much Right to what would support him, as to the Air he
respired. A contrary Way of arguing would be accusing the Deity with
Cruelty and Injustice, for he brought into the World no Man to pass a
Life of Penury, and to miserably want a necescessary Support; that the
vast Difference between Man and Man, the one wallowing in Luxury, and
the other in the most pinching Necessity, was owing only to Avarice and
Ambition on the one Hand, and a pusilanimous Subjection on the other;
that at first no other than a Natural was known, a paternal Government,
every Father was the Head, the Prince and Monarch of his Family, and
Obedience to such was both just and easy, for a Father had a
compassionate Tenderness for his Children; but Ambition creeping in by
Degrees, the stronger Family set upon and enslaved the Weaker; and this
additional Strength over-run a third, by every Conquest gathering Force
to make others, and this was the first Foundation of Monarchy. Pride
encreasing with Power, Man usurped the Prerogative of God, over his
Creatures, that of depriving them of Life, which was a Privilege no one
had over his own; for as he did not come into the World by his own
Election, he ought to stay the determined Time of his Creator: That
indeed, Death given in War, was by the Law of Nature allowable, because
it is for the Preservation of our own Lives; but no Crime ought to be
thus punished, nor indeed any War undertaken, but in Defence of our
natural Right, which is such a Share of Earth as is necessary for our
Support.

These Topicks he often declaimed on, and very often advised with
_Misson_ about the setting up for themselves; he was as ambitious as the
other, and as resolute. _Caraccioli_ and _Misson_ were by this expert
Mariners, and very capable of managing a Ship: _Caraccioli_ had sounded
a great many of the Men on this Subject, and found them very inclineable
to listen to him. An Accident happen'd which gave _Caraccioli_ a fair
Opportunity to put his Designs in Execution, and he laid Hold of it;
they went off _Martinico_ on a Cruize, and met with the _Winchelsea_, an
_English_ Man of War of 40 Guns, commanded by Captain _Jones_; they made
for each other, and a very smart Engagement followed, the first
Broadside killed the Captain, second Captain, and the three Lieutenants,
on Board the _Victoire_, and left only the Master, who would have
struck, but _Misson_ took up the Sword, order'd _Caraccioli_ to act as
Lieutenant, and encouraging the Men fought the Ship six Glasses, when by
some Accident, the _Winchelsea_ blew up, and not a Man was saved but
Lieutenant _Franklin_, whom the _French_ Boats took up, and he died in
two Days. None ever knew before this Manuscript fell into my Hands how
the _Winchelsea_ was lost; for her Head being driven ashore at
_Antegoa_, and a great Storm having happen'd a few Days before her Head
was found, it was concluded, that she founder'd in that Storm. After
this Engagement, _Caraccioli_ came to _Misson_ and saluted him Captain,
and desired to know if he would chuse a momentary or a lasting Command,
that he must now determine, for at his Return to _Martinico_ it would be
too late; and he might depend upon the Ship he fought and saved being
given to another, and they would think him well rewarded if made a
Lieutenant, which Piece of Justice he doubted: That he had his Fortune
in his Hands, which he might either keep or let go; if he made Choice of
the latter, he must never again expect she would court him to accept her
Favours: That he ought to set before his Eyes his Circumstances, as a
younger Brother of a good Family, but nothing to support his Character;
and the many Years he must serve at the Expence of his Blood before he
could make any Figure in the World; and consider the wide Difference
between the commanding and being commanded: That he might with the Ship
he had under Foot, and the brave Fellows under Command, bid Defiance to
the Power of _Europe_, enjoy every Thing he wish'd, reign Sovereign of
the Southern Seas, and lawfully make War on all the World, since it
wou'd deprive him of that Liberty to which he had a Right by the Laws of
Nature: That he might in Time, become as great as _Alexander_ was to the
_Persians_; and by encreasing his Forces by his Captures, he would every
Day strengthen the Justice of his Cause, for who has Power is always in
the Right. That _Harry_ the Fourth and _Harry_ the Seventh, attempted
and succeeded in their Enterprizes on the Crown of _England_, yet their
Forces did not equal his. _Mahomet_ with a few Camel Drivers, founded
the _Ottoman_ Empire; and _Darius_, with no more than six or seven
Companions got Possession of that of _Persia_.

In a Word he said so much that _Misson_ resolved to follow his Advice,
and calling up all Hands, he told them, 'That a great Number of them had
resolved with him upon a Life of Liberty, and had done him the Honour to
create him Chief: That he designed to force no Man, and be guilty of
that Injustice he blamed in others; therefore, if any were averse to the
following his Fortune, which he promised should be the same to all, he
desired they would declare themselves, and he would set them ashore,
whence they might return with Conveniency;' having made an End, they one
and all cryed, Vive le Capitain _Misson_ et son Lieutenant le Scavant
_Caraccioli_, God bless Capt. _Misson_ and his learned Lieutenant
_Caraccioli_. _Misson_ thanked them for the Honour they conferr'd upon
him, and promised he would use the Power they gave for the publick Good
only, and hoped, as they had the Bravery to assert their Liberty, they
would be as unanimous in the preserving it, and stand by him in what
should be found expedient for the Good of all; that he was their Friend
and Companion, and should never exert his Power, or think himself other
than their Comrade, but when the Necessity of Affairs should oblige him.

They shouted a second Time, _vive le Capitain_; he, after this, desired
they would chuse their subaltern Officers, and give them Power to
consult and conclude upon what might be for the common Interest, and
bind themselves down by an Oath to agree to what such Officers and he
should determine: This they readily gave into. The School-Master they
chose for second Lieutenant, _Jean Besace_ they nominated for third, and
the Boatswain, and a Quarter-Master, named _Matthieu le Tondu_, with the
Gunner, they desired might be their Representatives in Council.

The Choice was approved, and that every Thing might pass methodically,
and with general Approbation, they were called into the great Cabbin,
and the Question put, what Course they should steer? The Captain
proposed the _Spanish_ Coast as the most probable to afford them rich
Prizes: This was agreed upon by all. The Boatswain then asked what
Colours they should fight under, and advised Black as most terrifying;
but _Caraccioli_ objected, that they were no Pyrates, but Men who were
resolved to assert that Liberty which God and Nature gave them, and own
no Subjection to any, farther than was for the common Good of all: That
indeed, Obedience to Governors was necessary, when they knew and acted
up to the Duty of their Function; were vigilant Guardians of the Peoples
Rights and Liberties; saw that Justice was equally distributed; were
Barriers against the Rich and Powerful, when they attempted to oppress
the Weaker; when they suffered none of the one Hand to grow immensely
rich, either by his own or his Ancestors Encroachments; nor on the
other, any to be wretchedly miserable, either by falling into the Hands
of Villains, unmerciful Creditors, or other Misfortunes. While he had
Eyes impartial, and allowed nothing but Merit to distinguish between Man
and Man; and instead of being a Burthen to the People by his luxurious
Life, he was by his Care for, and Protection of them, a real Father, and
in every Thing acted with the equal and impartial Justice of a Parent:
But when a Governor, who is the Minister of the People, thinks himself
rais'd to this Dignity, that he may spend his Days in Pomp and Luxury,
looking upon his Subjects as so many Slaves, created for his Use and
Pleasure, and therefore leaves them and their Affairs to the
immeasurable Avarice and Tyranny of some one whom he has chosen for his
Favourite, when nothing but Oppression, Poverty, and all the Miseries of
Life flow from such an Administration; that he lavishes away the Lives
and Fortunes of the People, either to gratify his Ambition, or to
support the Cause of some neighbouring Prince, that he may in Return,
strengthen his Hands should his People exert themselves in Defence of
their native Rights; or should he run into unnecessary Wars, by the rash
and thoughtless Councils of his Favourite, and not able to make Head
against the Enemy he has rashly or wantonly brought upon his Hands, and
buy a Peace (which is the present Case of _France_, as every one knows,
by supporting King _James_, and afterwards proclaiming his Son) and
drain the Subject; should the Peoples Trade be wilfully neglected, for
private Interests, and while their Ships of War lie idle in their
Harbours, suffer their Vessels to be taken; and the Enemy not only
intercepts all Commerce, but insults their Coasts: It speaks a generous
and great Soul to shake off the Yoak; and if we cannot redress our
Wrongs, withdraw from sharing the Miseries which meaner Spirits submit
to, and scorn to yield to the Tyranny. Such Men are we, and, if the
World, as Experience may convince us it will, makes War upon us, the Law
of Nature empowers us not only to be on the defensive, but also on the
offensive Part. As we then do not proceed upon the same Ground with
Pyrates, who are Men of dissolute Lives and no Principles, let us scorn
to take their Colours: Ours is a brave, a just, an innocent, and a noble
Cause; the Cause of Liberty. I therefore advise a white Ensign, with
Liberty painted in the Fly, and if you like the Motto, _a Deo a
Libertate_, for God and Liberty, as an Emblem of our Uprightness and
Resolution.

The Cabbin Door was left open, and the Bulk Head which was of Canvas
rowled up, the Steerage being full of Men, who lent an attentive Ear,
they cried, Liberty, Liberty; we are free Men: _Vive_ the brave Captain
_Misson_ and the noble Lieutenant _Caraccioli_. This short Council
breaking up, every Thing belonging to the deceas'd Captain, and the
other Officers, and Men lost in the Engagement, was brought upon Deck
and over-hawled; the Money ordered to be put into a Chest, and the
Carpenter to clap on a Padlock for, and give a Key to, every one of the
Council: _Misson_ telling them, all should be in common, and the
particular Avarice of no one should defraud the Publick.

When the Plate Monsieur _Fourbin_ had, was going to the Chest, the Men
unanimously cried out avast, keep that out for the Captain's Use, as a
Present from his Officers and Fore-mast Men. _Misson_ thanked them, the
Plate was returned to the great Cabbin, and the Chest secured according
to Orders: _Misson_ then ordered his Lieutenants and other Officers to
examine who among the Men, were in most Want of Cloaths, and to
distribute those of the dead Men impartially, which was done with a
general Consent and Applause of the whole Crew: All but the wounded
being upon Deck. _Misson_ from the Baracade, spoke to the following
Purpose, 'That since they had unanimously resolved to seize upon and
defend their Liberty, which ambitious Men had usurped, and that this
could not be esteemed by impartial Judges other than a just and brave
Resolution, he was under an Obligation to recommend to them a brotherly
Love to each other; the Banishment of all private Piques and Grudges,
and a strict Agreement and Harmony among themselves: That in throwing
off the Yoak of Tyranny of which the Action spoke an Abhorrence, he
hoped none would follow the Example of Tyrants, and turn his Back upon
Justice; for when Equity was trodden under Foot, Misery, Confusion, and
mutual Distrust naturally followed.'--He also advised them to remember
there was a Supream, the Adoration of which, Reason and Gratitude
prompted us, and our own Interests would engage us (as it is best to be
of the surest Side, and after-Life was allowed possible) to
conciliate.--That he was satisfied Men who were born and bred in
Slavery, by which their Spirits were broke, and were incapable of so
generous a Way of thinking, who, ignorant of their Birth-Right, and the
Sweets of Liberty, dance to the Musick of their Chains, which was,
indeed, the greater Part of the Inhabitants of the Globe, would brand
this generous Crew with the invidious Name of Pyrates, and think it
meritorious, to be instrumental in their Destruction.--Self-Preservation
therefore, and not a cruel Disposition, obliged him to declare War
against all such as should refuse him the Entry of their Ports, and
against all, who should not immediately surrender and give up what their
Necessities required; but in a more particular Manner against all
_European_ Ships and Vessels, as concluded implacable Enemies. _And I do
now_, said he, _declare such War, and, at the same time, recommend to
you my Comrades a humane and generous Behaviour towards your Prisoners;
which will appear by so much more the Effects of a noble Soul, as we are
satisfied we should not meet the same Treatment should our ill Fortune,
or more properly our Disunion, or want of Courage, give us up to their
Mercy_.

After this, he required a Muster should be made, and there were able
Hands two Hundred, and thirty five sick and wounded; as they were
muster'd they were sworn. After Affairs were thus settled, they shaped
their Course for the _Spanish West-Indies_, but resolved, in the Way, to
take a Week or ten Days Cruize in the Windward Passage from _Jamaica_,
because most Merchant Men, which were good Sailors and did not stay for
Convoy, took this as the shorter Cut for _England_.

Off St. _Christophers_ they took an _English_ Sloop becalmed, with their
Boats; they took out of her a couple of Puncheons of Rum, and half a
dozen Hogsheads of Sugar (she was a _New England_ Sloop, bound for
_Boston_) and without offering the least Violence to the Men, or
stripping them, they let her go. The Master of the Sloop was _Thomas
Butler_, who owned, he never met with so candid an Enemy as the _French_
Man of War, which took him the Day he left St. _Christophers_; they met
with no other Booty in their Way, till they came upon their Station,
when after three Days, they saw a Sloop which had the Impudence to give
them Chace; Captain _Misson_ asked what could be the Meaning that the
Sloop stood for them? One of the Men, who was acquainted with the
_West-Indies_, told him, it was a _Jamaica_ Privateer, and he should not
wonder, if he clapp'd him aboard. I am, said he, no Stranger to their
Way of working, and this despicable Fellow, as those who don't know a
_Jamaica_ Privateer may think him, it is ten to one will give you some
Trouble. It now grows towards Evening, and you'll find as soon as he has
discovered your Force, he'll keep out of the Reach of your Guns till the
12 a-Clock Watch is changed at Night, and he'll then attempt to clap you
aboard, with Hopes to carry you in the Hurry: Wherefore Captain, if you
will give me Leave to advise you, let every Man have his small Arms; and
at twelve, let the Bell ring as usual, and rather more Noise than
ordinary be made, as if the one Watch was turning in, and the other out,
in a Confusion and Hurry, and I'll engage he will venture to enter his
Men. The Fellow's Advice was approved and resolved upon, and the Sloop
work'd, as he said she would, for upon coming near enough to make
distinctly the Force of the _Victoire_, on her throwing out _French_
Colours, she, the Sloop, clapp'd upon a Wind, the _Victoire_ gave Chace,
but without Hopes of gaining upon her; she went so well to Windward,
that she cou'd spare the Ship some Points in her Sheet, and yet wrong
her: At Dusk of the Even, the _French_ had lost Sight of her, but about
Eleven at Night, they saw her hankering up their Windward Bow, which
confirmed the Sailors Opinion, that she would attempt to board them, as
she did at the pretended Change of the Watch; there being little or no
Wind, she lashed to the Bow-Sprit of the _Victoire_, and enter'd her
Men, who were very quietly taken, as they enter'd and tumbled down the
Fore-hatch, where they were received by others, and bound without Noise,
not one of the Privateers killed, few hurt, and only one _Frenchman_
wounded. The _Victoire_ seeing the better Part of the Sloop's Men
secured, they boarded in their Turn, when the Privateer's suspecting
some Stratagem, were endeavouring to cut their Lashing and get off: Thus
the _Englishman_ caught a Tartar. The Prisoners being all secured, the
Captain charged his Men not to discover, thro' a Desire of augmenting
their Number, the Account they were upon.

The next Morning Monsieur _Misson_ called for the Captain of the
Privateer, he told him, he could not but allow him a brave Fellow, to
venture upon a Ship of his Countenance, and for that Reason he should
meet Treatment which Men of his Profession seldom afforded the Prisoners
they made. He asked him how long he had been out, what was his Name, and
what he had on Board? He answered he was but just come out, that he was
the first Sail he had met with, and shou'd have thought himself
altogether as lucky not to have spoke with him; that his Name was _Harry
Ramsey_, and what he had on Board were Rags, Powder, Ball, and some few
half Anchors of Rum. _Ramsey_ was ordered into the Gun-Room, and a
Council being held in the publick Manner aforesaid, the Bulk Head of the
great Cabbin rowled up. On their Conclusion, the Captain of the
Privateer was called in again, when Captain _Misson_ told him, he would
return him his Sloop, and restore him and his Men to their Liberty,
without stripping or plundering of any Thing, but what Prudence obliged
him to, their Ammunition and Small-Arms, if he would give him his Word
and Honour, and his Men to take an Oath, not to go out on the Privateer
Account in six Months after they left him: That he did not design to
continue that Station above a Week longer, at the Expiration of which
Time he would let them go.

_Ramsey_, who had a new Sloop, did not expect this Favour, which he
thanked him for, and promised punctually to comply with the Injunction,
which his Men as readily swore to, tho' they had no Design to keep the
Oath. The Time being expired, he and his Men were put on Board their own
Sloop. At going over the Ship's Side _Ramsey_ begg'd Monsieur _Misson_
would allow him Powder for a salute, by way of Thanks; but he answered
him, the Ceremony was needless, and he expected no other Return than
that of keeping his Word, which indeed _Ramsey_ did. Some of his Men had
found it more to their Advantage to have been as religious.

At parting _Ramsey_ gave the Ship three Chears, and _Misson_ had the
Complaisance to return one, which _Ramsey_ answering with three more,
made the best of his Way for _Jamaica_, and at the East End of the
Island met with the _Diana_, who, upon Advice, turn'd back.

The _Victoire_ steer'd for _Carthagene_, off which Port they cruised
some Days, but meeting with nothing in the Seas, they made for _Porto
Bello_; in their Way they met with two _Dutch_ Traders, who had Letters
of Mart, and were just come upon the Coast, the one had 20, the other 24
Guns; _Misson_ engaged them, and they defended themselves with a great
Deal of Resolution and Gallantry; and as they were mann'd a Peak, he
durst not venture to board either of them, for fear of being at the same
Time boarded by the other. His Weight of Mettal gave him a great
Advantage over the _Dutch_, though they were two to one; besides, their
Business, as they had Cargoes, was to get off, if possible, wherefore
they made a running Fight, though they took Care to stick close to one
another.

They maintained the Fight for above six Hours, when _Misson_, enraged at
this Obstinacy, and fearing, if by Accident they should bring a Mast, or
Top-Mast, by the board, they would get from him. He was resolved to sink
the larger Ship of the two, and accordingly ordered his Men to bring all
their Guns to bear a Midship, then running close along Side of him, to
raise their Mettal; his Orders being punctually obey'd, he pour'd in a
Broad Side, which open'd such a Gap in the _Dutch_ Ship, that she went
directly to the Bottom, and every Man perish'd.

He then mann'd his Bowsprit, brought his Sprit-sail Yard fore and aft,
and resolved to board the other, which the _Dutch_ perceiving, and
terrified with the unhappy Fate of their Comrade, thought a farther
resistance vain, and immediately struck. _Misson_ gave them good
Quarters, though he was enraged at the Loss of 13 Men killed outright,
beside 9 wounded, of which 6 died. They found on board a great Quantity
of Gold and Silver Lace, brocade Silks, Silk Stockings, Bails of
Broad-Cloath, Bazes of all Colours, and _Osnabrughs_.

A Consultation being held, it was resolved Captain _Misson_ should take
the Name of _Fourbin_, and returning to _Carthagene_, dispose of his
Prize, and set his Prisoners ashoar. Accordingly they ply'd to the
Eastward, and came to an Anchor between _Boca Chieca_ Fort, and the
Town, for they did not think it expedient to enter the Harbour. The
Barge was manned, and _Caraccioli_, with the Name of _D'Aubigny_, the
first Lieutenant, who was killed in the Engagement with the
_Winchelsea_, and his Commission in his Pocket, went ashore with a
Letter to the Governor, sign'd _Fourbin_, whose Character, for fear of
the worst, was exactly counterfeited. The Purport of his Letter was,
that having discretionary Orders to cruize for three Months, and hearing
the _English_ infested his Coast, he was come in search of 'em, and had
met two _Dutch_ Men, one of which he had sunk, the other he made Prize
of. That his limited Time being near expired, he should be obliged to
his Excellency, if he would send on board him such Merchants as were
willing to take the Ship and Cargoe off his Hands, of which he had sent
the _Dutch_ Invoice. Don _Joseph de la Zerda_, the then Governor,
received the Lieutenant (who sent back the Barge at landing) very
civilly, and agreed to take the Prisoners ashoar, and do every Thing was
required of him; and ordering fresh Provisions and Sallading to be got
ready as a Present for the Captain, he sent for some Merchants who were
very ready to go on board, and agree for the Ship and Goods; which they
did, for two and fifty thousand Pieces of Eight. The next Day the
Prisoners were set ashoar; a rich Piece of Brocade which was reserv'd,
sent to the Governor for a Present, a Quantity of fresh Provision bought
and brought on board, the Money paid by the Merchants, the Ship and
Goods deliver'd, and the _Victoire_, at the Dawn of the following Day,
got under Sail. It may be wonder'd how such Dispatch could be made, but
the Reader must take Notice, these Goods were sold by the _Dutch_
Invoice, which the Merchant of the Prize affirmed was genuine. I shall
observe, by the by, that the _Victoire_ was the _French_ Man of War
which Admiral _Wager_ sent the _Kingston_ in search of, and being
afterwards falsly inform'd, that she was join'd by another of seventy
Guns; and that they cruiz'd together between the Capes, order'd the
_Severn_ up to Windward, to assist the _Kingston_, which had like to
have prov'd very fatal; for these two _English_ Men of War, commanded by
Captain _Trevor_ and Captain _Pudnor_, meeting in the Night, had
prepared to engage, each taking the other for the Enemy. The
_Kingston_'s Men not having a good Look-out, which must be attributed to
the Negligence of the Officer of the Watch, did not see the _Severn_
till she was just upon them; but, by good Luck, to Leeward, and plying
up, with all the Sail she could crowd, and a clear Ship. This put the
_Kingston_ in such Confusion, that when the _Severn_ hal'd, no Answer
was return'd, for none heard her. She was got under the _Kingston_'s
Stern, and Captain _Pudnor_ ordered to hale for the third and last Time,
and if no Answer was return'd, to give her a Broadside. The Noise on
Board the _Kingston_ was now a little ceas'd, and Captain _Trevor_, who
was on the Poop with a speaking Trumpet to hale the _Severn_, by good
Luck heard her hale him, and answering the _Kingston_, and asking the
Name of the other Ship, prevented the Damage.

They cruised together some Time, and meeting nothing which answer'd
their Information, return'd to _Jamaica_, as I shall to my Subject,
begging Pardon for this, as I thought, necessary Digression.

Don _Juan de la Zerda_ told the Captain in a Letter, that the St.
_Joseph_, a Gallion of seventy Guns, was then lying at _Port a Bello_,
and should be glad he could keep her Company till she was off the Coast.
That she would sail in eight or ten Days for the _Havanna_; and that, if
his Time would permit him, he would send an Advice-Boat. That she had on
Board the Value of 800,000 Pieces of Eight in Silver and Bar Gold.
_Misson_ return'd Answer, that he believ'd he should be excus'd if he
stretched his Orders, for a few Days; and that he would cruize off the
Isle of _Pearls_, and Cape _Gratias a Dios_, and give for Signal to the
Gallion, his spreading a white Ensign in his Fore-Top-Mast Shrouds, the
cluing up his Fore-Sail, and the firing one Gun to Windward, and two to
Leeward, which he should answer by letting run and hoisting his
Fore-Top-Sail three times, and the firing as many Guns to Leeward. Don
_Joseph_, extreamly pleased with this Complaisance, sent a Boat express
to advise the St. _Joseph_, but she was already sailed two Days,
contrary to the Governor of _Carthagene_'s Expectation, and this Advice
Captain _Misson_ had from the Boat, which returning with an Answer, saw
the _Victoire_ in the Offin, and spoke to her. It was then resolved to
follow the St. _Joseph_, and accordingly they steer'd for the _Havanna_,
but by what Accident they did not overtake her is unknown.

I forgot to tell my Reader, on Board the _Dutch_ Ship were fourteen
_French_ Hugonots, whom _Misson_ thought fit to detain, when they were
at Sea. _Misson_ called 'em up, and proposed to 'em their taking on;
telling them at the same Time, he left it to their Choice, for he would
have no forc'd Men; and that if they all, or any of them, disapproved
the Proposal, he would either give 'em the first Vessel he met that was
fit for 'em, or set 'em ashoar on some inhabited Coast; and therefore
bid 'em take two Days for Consideration before they returned an Answer;
and, to encourage 'em, he called all Hands up, and declar'd, that if any
Man repented him of the Course of Life he had chosen, his just Dividend
should be counted to him, and he would set him on Shoar, either near the
_Havanna_, or some other convenient Place; but not one accepted the
Offer, and the fourteen Prisoners unanimously resolved to join in with
'em; to which Resolution, no doubt, the Hopes of a good Booty from the
St. _Joseph_, and this Offer of Liberty greatly contributed.

At the Entrance of the Gulph they spied and came with a large Merchant
Ship bound for _London_ from _Jamaica_; she had 20 Guns, but no more
than 32 Hands, that its not to be wonder'd at she made no Resistance,
besides, she was deep laden with Sugars. Monsieur _Misson_ took out of
her what Ammunition she had, about four thousand Pieces of Eight, some
Puncheons of Rum, and ten Hogsheads of Sugar; and, without doing her any
further Damage, let her proceed her Voyage. What he valued most in this
Prize was the Men he got, for she was carrying to _Europe_ twelve
_French_ Prisoners, two of which were necessary Hands, being a Carpenter
and his Mate. They were of _Bourdeaux_, from whence they came with the
_Pomechatraine_, which was taken by the _Maremaid_ off _Petit Guavers_,
after an obstinate Resistance, in which they lost forty Men; but they
were of Opinion the _Maremaid_ could not have taken 'em, having but four
Guns less than she had, which was made amends for, by their having about
thirty Hands. On the contrary, had not the _Guernsey_ come up, they
thought of boarding and carrying the _Maremaid_. These Men very
willingly came into Captain _Misson_'s Measures.

These Men, who had been stripp'd to the Skin, begg'd Leave to make
Reprisals, but the Captain would not suffer them, though he told the
Master of the Prize, as he protected him and his Men, he thought it
reasonable these _French_ should be cloathed: Upon this the Master
contributed of his own, and every Man bringing up his Chest, thought
themselves very well off in sharing with them one half.

Though _Misson_'s Ship pass'd for a _French_ Man of War, yet his
Generosity in letting the Prize go, gave the _English_ Grounds to
suspect the Truth, neither the Ship nor Cargoe being of Use to such as
were upon the grand Account.

When they had lost all Hopes of the St. _Joseph_, they coasted along the
North-Side of _Cuba_, and the _Victoire_ growing now foul, they ran into
a Landlock'd Bay on the East North-East Point, where they hove her down
by Boats and Guns, though they could not pretend to heave her Keel out;
however, they scraped and tallowed as far as they could go; they, for
this Reason, many of them repented they had let the last Prize go, by
which they might have careened.

When they had righted the Ship, and put every Thing on Board, they
consulted upon the Course they should steer. Upon this the Council
divided. The Captain and _Caraccioli_ were for stretching over to the
_African_, and the others for the _New-England_ Coast, alledging, that
the Ship had a foul Bottom, and was not fit for the Voyage; and that if
they met with contrary Winds, and bad Weather, their Stock of Provision
might fall short; and that as they were not far from the _English_
Settlement of _Carolina_, they might either on that or the Coast of
_Virginia_, _Maryland_, _Pensylvania_, _New-York_, or _New-England_,
intercept Ships which traded to the Islands with Provisions, and by that
Means provide themselves with Bread, Flower, and other Necessaries. An
Account of the Provisions were taken, and finding they had Provisions
for four Months. Captain _Misson_ called all Hands upon Deck, and told
them, as the Council differed in the Course they should steer, he
thought it reasonable to have it put to the Vote of the whole Company.
That for his Part, he was for going to the Coasts of _Guiney_, where
they might reasonably expect to meet with valuable Prizes; but should
they fail in their Expectation one Way, they would be sure of having it
answered another; for they could then throw themselves in that of the
_East-India_ Ships, and he need not tell them, that the outward bound
dreined _Europe_ of what Money they drew from _America_. He then gave
the Sentiments of those who were against him, and their Reasons, and
begg'd that every one would give his Opinion and Vote according as he
thought most conducive to the Good of all. That he should be far from
taking it ill if they should reject what he had proposed, since he had
no private Views to serve. The Majority of Votes fell on the Captain's
Side, and they accordingly shaped their Course for the Coast of
_Guiney_, in which Voyage nothing remarkable happened. On their Arrival
on the Gold-Coast, they fell in with the _Nieuwstadt_ of _Amsterdam_, a
Ship of 18 Guns, commanded by Capt. _Blaes_, who made a running Fight of
five Glasses: This Ship they kept with them, putting on Board 40 Hands,
and bringing all the Prisoners on Board the _Victoire_, they were Forty
three in Number; they left _Amsterdam_ with Fifty six, seven were killed
in the Engagement, and they had lost six by Sickness and Accidents, one
falling overboard, and one being taken by a Shark going overboard in a
Calm.

The _Nieuwstadt_ had some Gold-Dust on Board, to the Value of about 2000
l. Sterling, and a few Slaves to the Number of Seventeen, for she had
but begun to Trade; the Slaves were a strengthening of their Hands, for
the Captain order'd them to be cloathed out of _Dutch_ Mariners Chests,
and told his Men, 'That the Trading for those of our own Species, cou'd
never be agreeable to the Eyes of divine Justice: That no Man had Power
of the Liberty of another; and while those who profess'd a more
enlightened Knowledge of the Deity, sold Men like Beasts; they prov'd
that their Religion was no more than Grimace, and that they differ'd
from the _Barbarians_ in Name only, since their Practice was in nothing
more humane: For his Part, and he hop'd, he spoke the Sentiments of all
his brave Companions, he had not exempted his Neck from the galling Yoak
of Slavery, and asserted his own Liberty, to enslave others. That
however, these Men were distinguish'd from the _Europeans_ by their
Colour, Customs, or religious Rites, they were the Work of the same
omnipotent Being, and endued with equal Reason: Wherefore, he desired
they might be treated like Freemen (for he wou'd banish even the Name of
Slavery from among them) and divided into Messes among them, to the End
they might the sooner learn their Language, be sensible of the
Obligation they had to them, and more capable and zealous to defend that
Liberty they owed to their Justice and Humanity.'

This Speech of _Misson_'s was received with general Applause, and the
Ship rang with _vive le Capitain_ Misson. Long live Capt. _Misson_.--The
Negroes were divided among the _French_, one to a Mess, who, by their
Gesticulations, shew'd they were gratefully sensible of their being
delivered from their Chains. Their Ship growing very foul, and going
heavily through the Water, they run into the River of _Lagoa_, where
they hove her down, taking out such Planks as had suffer'd most by the
Worms, and substituting new in their Room.

After this they careened the Prize, and so put out to Sea, steering to
the Southward, and keeping along the Coast, but met with Nothing. All
this while, the greatest Decorum and Regularity was observed on Board
the _Victoire_; but the _Dutch_ Prisoners Example began to lead 'em into
Swearing and Drunkenness, which the Captain remarking, thought it was
best to nip these Vices in the Bud; and calling both the _French_ and
_Dutch_ upon Deck, he address'd himself to the former, desiring their
Captain, who spoke _French_ excellently well, to interpret what he said
to those who did not understand him. He told them, 'before he had the
Misfortune of having them on Board, his Ears were never grated with
hearing the Name of the great Creator prophaned, tho' he, to his Sorrow,
had often since heard his own Men guilty of that Sin, which administer'd
neither Profit nor Pleasure, and might draw upon them a severe
Punishment: That if they had a just Idea of that great Being, they wou'd
never mention him, but they wou'd immediately reflect on his Purity and
their own Vileness. That we so easily took Impression from our Company,
that the _Spanish_ Proverb says, _let a Hermit and a Thief live
together, the Thief wou'd become Hermit, or the Hermit Thief_: That he
saw this verified in his Ship, for he cou'd attribute the Oaths and
Curses he had heard among his brave Companions, to nothing but the
odious Example of the _Dutch_: That this was not the only Vice they had
introduced, for before they were on Board, his Men were Men, but he
found by their beastly Pattern they were degenerated into Brutes, by
drowning that only Faculty, which distinguishes between Man and Beast,
_Reason_. That as he had the Honour to command them, he could not see
them run into these odious Vices without a sincere Concern, as he had a
paternal Affection for them; and he should reproach himself as
neglectful of the common Good, if he did not admonish them; and as by
the Post which they had honour'd him, he was obliged to have a watchful
Eye over their general Interest; he was obliged to tell them his
Sentiments were, that the _Dutch_ allured them to a dissolute Way of
Life, that they might take some Advantage over them: Wherefore, as his
brave Companions, he was assured, wou'd be guided by Reason, he gave the
_Dutch_ Notice, that the first whom he catch'd either with an Oath in
his Mouth or Liquor in his Head, should be brought to the Geers, whipped
and pickled, for an Example to the rest of his Nation: As to his
Friends, his Companions, his Children, those gallant, those generous,
noble, and heroick Souls he had the Honour to command, he entreated them
to allow a small Time for Reflection, and to consider how little
Pleasure, and how much Danger, might flow from imitating the Vices of
their Enemies; and that they would among themselves, make a Law for the
Suppression of what would otherwise estrange them from the Source of
Life, and consequently leave them destitute of his Protection.'

It is not to be imagined what Efficacy this Speech had on both Nations:
The _Dutch_ grew continent in Fear of Punishment, and the _French_ in
Fear of being reproach'd by their good Captain, for they never mentioned
him without this Epithet. Upon the Coast of _Angola_, they met with a
second _Dutch_ Ship, the Cargo of which consisted of Silk and Woolen
Stuffs, Cloath, Lace, Wine, Brandy, Oyl, Spice, and hard Ware; the Prize
gave Chase and engaged her, but upon the coming up of the _Victoire_ she
struck. This Ship opportunely came in their Way, and gave full Employ to
the Taylors, who were on Board, for the whole Crew began to be out at
Elbows: They plundered her of what was of Use to their own Ship, and
then sunk her.

The Captain having about ninety Prisoners on Board, proposed the giving
them the Prize, with what was necessary for their Voyage, and sending
them away; which being agreed to, they shifted her Ammunition on Board
the _Victoire_, and giving them Provision to carry them to the
Settlements the _Dutch_ have on the Coast, _Misson_ called them up, told
them what was his Design, and ask'd if any of them was willing to share
his Fortune: Eleven _Dutch_ came into him, two of which were
Sail-makers, one an Armourer, and one a Carpenter, necessary Hands; the
rest he let go, not a little surprised at the Regularity, Tranquillity,
and Humanity, which they found among these new-fashioned Pyrates.

They had now run the Length of _Soldinia_ Bay, about ten Leagues to the
Northward of _Table_ Bay. As here is good Water, safe Riding, plenty of
Fish and fresh Provision, to be got of the Natives for the Merchandize
they had on Board, it was resolved to stay here some little Time for
Refreshments. When they had the Bay open, they spied a tall Ship, which
instantly got under sail, and hove out _English_ Colours. The _Victoire_
made a clear Ship, and hove out her _French_ Ensign, and a smart
Engagement began. The _English_ was a new Ship built for 40 Guns, though
she had but 32 mounted, and 90 Hands. _Misson_ gave Orders for boarding,
and his Number of fresh Men he constantly poured in, after an obstinate
Dispute obliged the _English_ to fly the Decks, and leave the _French_
Masters of their Ship, who promised, and gave them, good Quarters, and
stripp'd not a Man.

They found on Board the Prize some Bales of _English_ Broad-Cloath, and
about 60000 l. in _English_ Crown Pieces, and _Spanish_ Pieces of Eight.
The _English_ Captain was killed in the Engagement, and 14 of his Men:
The _French_ lost 12, which was no small Mortification, but did not
however provoke them to use their Prisoners harshly. Captain _Misson_
was sorry for the Death of the Commander, whom he buried on the Shoar,
and one of his Men being a Stone-Cutter, he raised a Stone over his
Grave with these Words, _Icy gist un brave Anglois_. Here lies a gallant
_English_ Man; when he was buried he made a tripple Discharge of 50
small Arms, and fired Minute Guns.

The _English_, knowing whose Hands they were fallen into, charm'd with
_Misson_'s Humanity, 30 of them, in 3 Days Space, desired to take on
with him. He accepted 'em, but at the same Time gave 'em to understand,
that in taking on with him they were not to expect they should be
indulged in a dissolute and immoral Life. He now divided his Company
between the two Ships, and made _Caraccioli_ Captain of the Prize,
giving him Officers chosen by the publick Suffrage. The 17 Negroes began
to understand a little _French_, and to be useful Hands, and in less
than a Month all the _English_ Prisoners came over to him, except their
Officers.

He had two Ships well mann'd with resolute Fellows; they now doubled the
Cape, and made the South End of _Madagascar_, and one of the _English_
Men telling Captain _Misson_, that the _European_ Ships bound for
_Surat_ commonly touch'd at the Island of _Johanna_, he sent for Captain
_Caraccioli_ on Board, and it was agreed to cruize off that Island. They
accordingly sailed on the West-Side of _Madagascar_ and off the Bay _de
Diego_. About half Seas over between that Bay and the Island of
_Johanna_, they came up with an _English East-India_ Man, which made
Signals of Distress as soon as she spy'd _Misson_ and his Prize; they
found her sinking by an unexpected Leak, and took all her Men on Board,
though they could get little out of her before she went down. The
_English_, who were thus miraculously saved from perishing, desired to
be set on Shoar at _Johanna_, where they hop'd to meet with either a
_Dutch_ or _English_ Ship in a little Time, and the mean while they were
sure of Relief.

They arrived at _Johanna_, and were kindly received by the Queen-Regent
and her Brother, on account of the _English_ on the one Hand, and of
their Strength on the other, which the Queen's Brother, who had the
Administration of Affairs, was not able to make Head against, and hoped
they might assist him against the King of _Mohila_, who threaten'd him
with a Visit.

This is an Island which is contiguous, in a manner, to _Johanna_, and
lies about N. W. and by N. from it. _Caraccioli_ told _Misson_ he might
make his Advantage in widening the Breach between these two little
Monarchies, and, by offering his Assistance to that of _Johanna_, in a
manner rule both, for these would court him as their Protector, and
those come to any Terms to buy his Friendship, by which Means he would
hold the Ballance of Power between them. He followed this Advice, and
offered his Friendship and Assistance to the Queen, who very readily
embraced it.

I must advise the Reader, that many of this Island speak _English_, and
that the _English_ Men who were of _Misson_'s Crew, and his
Interpreters, told them, their Captain, though not an _Englishman_, was
their Friend and Ally, and a Friend and Brother to the _Johanna_ Men,
for they esteem the _English_ beyond all other Nations.

They were supplied by the Queen with all Necessaries of Life, and
_Misson_ married her Sister, as _Caraccioli_ did the Daughter of her
Brother, whose Armory, which consisted before of no more than two rusty
Fire-Locks, and three Pistols, he furnish'd with thirty Fuzils, as many
Pair of Pistols, and gave him two Barrels of Powder, and four of Ball.

Several of his Men took Wives, and some required their Share of the
Prizes, which was justly given them, they designing to settle in this
Island, but the Number of these did not exceed ten, which Loss was
repaired by thirty of the Crew (they had saved from perishing) coming in
to him.

While they past their Time in all manner of Diversions the Place would
afford them, as hunting, feasting, and visiting the Island, the King of
_Mohila_ made a Descent, and alarm'd the whole Country. _Misson_ advised
the Queen's Brother not to give him any Impediment, but let him get into
the Heart of the Island, and he would take Care to intercept their
Return; but the Prince answered, should he follow his Advice the Enemy
would do him and the Subjects an irreparable Damage, in destroying the
Cocoa Walks, and for that Reason he must endeavour to stop his Progress.
Upon this Answer he asked the _English_ who were not under his Command,
if they were willing to join him in repelling the Enemies of their
common Host, and one and all consenting, he gave them Arms, and mixed
them with his own Men, and about the same Number of _Johannians_, under
the Command of _Caraccioli_ and the Queen's Brother, and arming out all
his Boats, he went himself to the Westward of the Island, where they
made their Descent. The Party which went by Land, fell in with, and beat
the _Mohilians_ with great Ease, who were in the greatest Consternation,
to find their Retreat cut off by _Misson_'s Boats. The _Johannians_,
whom they had often molested, were so enraged, that they gave Quarter to
none, and out of 300 who made the Descent, if _Misson_ and _Caraccioli_
had not interposed, not a Soul had escaped; 113 were taken Prisoners by
his Men, and carried on Board his Ships. These he sent safe to _Mohila_,
with a Message to the King, to desire he would make Peace with his
Friend and Ally the King of _Johanna_; but that Prince, little affected
with the Service done him in the Preservation of his Subjects, sent him
Word he took Laws from none, and knew when to make War and Peace without
his Advice, which he neither asked nor wanted. _Misson_, irritated by
this rude Answer, resolved to transfer the War into his own Country, and
accordingly set sail for _Mohila_, with about 100 _Johanna_ Men. The
Shoar, on Sight of the Ships, was filled with Men to hinder a Descent if
intended, but the great Guns soon dispersed this Rabble, and under their
Cover he landed the _Johannians_, and an equal Number of _French_ and
_English_. They were met by about 700 _Mohilians_, who pretended to stop
their Passage, but their Darts and Arrows were of little avail against
_Misson_'s Fuzils; the first Discharge made a great Slaughter, and about
20 Shells which were thrown among them, put them to a confus'd Flight.
The Party of _Europeans_ and _Johannians_ then marched to their
Metropolis, without Resistance, which they reduced to Ashes, and the
_Johannians_ cut down all the Cocoa Walks that they could for the Time,
for towards Evening they returned to their Ships, and stood off to Sea.

At their Return to _Johanna_ the Queen made a Festival, and magnified
the Bravery and Service of her Guests, Friends, and Allies. This Feast
lasted four Days, at the Expiration of which Time the Queen's Brother
proposed to Captain _Misson_ the making another Descent, in which he
would go in Person, and did not doubt subjecting the _Mohilians_; but
this was not the Design of _Misson_, who had Thoughts of fixing a
Retreat on the North West Side of _Madagascar_, and look'd upon the
Feuds between these two Islands advantageous to his Views, and therefore
no way his Interest to suffer the one to overcome the other; for while
the Variance was kept up, and their Forces pretty much upon a Level, it
was evident their Interest would make both Sides caress him; he
therefore answer'd, that they ought to deliberate on the Consequences,
for they might be deceived in their Hopes, and find the Conquest less
easy than they imagined. That the King of _Mohila_ would be more upon
his Guard, and not only intrench himself, but gall them with frequent
Ambuscades, by which they must inevitably lose a Number of Men; and, if
they were forced to retire with Loss, raise the Courage of the
_Mohilians_, and make them irreconcilable Enemies to the _Johannians_,
and intirely deprive him of the Advantages with which he might now make
a Peace, having twice defeated them: That he could not be always with
them, and at his leaving _Johanna_ he might expect the King of _Mohila_
would endeavour to take a bloody Revenge for the late Damages. The Queen
gave intirely into _Misson_'s Sentiments.

While this was in Agitation four _Mohilians_ arrived as Ambassadors to
propose a Peace. They finding the _Johannians_ upon high Terms, one of
them spoke to this Purpose; O ye _Johannians_, do not conclude from your
late Success, that Fortune will be always favourable; she will not
always give you the Protection of the _Europeans_, and without their
Help its possible you might now sue for a Peace, which you seem averse
to. Remember the Sun rises, comes to its Meridian Height, and stays not
there, but declines in a Moment. Let this admonish you to reflect on the
constant Revolution of all sublunary Affairs, and the greater is your
Glory, the nearer you are to your Declension. We are taught by every
Thing we see, that there is no Stability in the World, but Nature is in
continual Movement. The Sea which o'er flows the Sands has its Bounds
set, which it cannot pass, which the Moment it has reached, without
abiding, returns back to the Bosom of the Deep. Every Herb, every Shrub
and Tree, and even our own Bodies, teach us this Lesson, that nothing is
durable, or can be counted upon. Time passes away insensibly, one Sun
follows another, and brings its Changes with it. To Day's Globe of Light
sees you strengthened by these _Europeans_ elate with Victory, and we,
who have been used to conquer you, come to ask a Peace. To Morrow's Sun
may see you deprived of your present Succours, and the _Johannians_
petitioning us; as therefore we cannot say what to Morrow may bring
forth, it would be unwise on uncertain Hopes to forego a certain
Advantage, as surely Peace ought to be esteem'd by every wise Man.

Having said this, the Ambassadors withdrew, and were treated by the
Queen's Orders. After the Council had concluded, they were again call'd
upon, and the Queen told them, that by the Advice of her good Friends,
the _Europeans_, and those of her Council, she agreed to make a Peace,
which she wish'd might banish all Memory of former Injuries. That they
must own the War was begun by them, and that she was far from being the
Agressor; she only defended her self in her own Kingdom, which they had
often invaded, though, till within few Days, she had never molested
their Coasts. If then they really desired to live amicably with her,
they must resolve to send two of the King's Children, and ten of the
first Nobility, as Hostages, that they might, when they pleased, return,
for that was the only Terms on which she would desist prosecuting the
Advantages she now had, with the utmost Vigour.

The Ambassadors return'd with this Answer, and, about ten Days after,
the two Ships appearing upon their Coasts, they sent off to give Notice,
that their King comply'd with the Terms proposed, would send the
Hostages, and desired a Cessation of all Hostility, and, at the same
Time, invited the Commanders on Shoar. The _Johanna_ Men on Board
disswaded their accepting the Invitation; but _Misson_ and _Caraccioli_,
fearing nothing, went, but arm'd their Boat's Crew. They were received
by the King with Demonstrations of Friendship, and they dined with him
under a Tamerane Tree; but when they parted from him, and were returning
to their Boats, they were inclosed by, at least, 100 of the _Mohilians_,
who set upon them with the utmost Fury, and, in the first Flight of
Arrows, wounded both the Captains, and killed four of their Boat's Crew
of eight, who were with them; they, in return, discharged their Pistols
with some Execution, and fell in with their Cutlasses; but all their
Bravery would have stood them in little Stead, had not the Report of
their Pistols alarm'd and brought the rest of their Friends to their
Assistance, who took their Fuzils, and coming up while they were
engaged, discharged a Volley on the Back of the Assailants, which laid
twelve of them dead on the Spot. The Ships hearing this Fire, sent
immediately the Yawls and Long-Boats well mann'd. Though the Islanders
were a little damp'd in their Courage by this Fire of the Boats Crew,
yet they did not give over the Fight, and one of them desperately threw
himself upon _Caraccioli_, and gave him a deep Wound in his Side, with a
long Knife, but he paid for the Rashness of the Attempt with his Life,
one of the Crew cleaving his Skull. The Yawls and Long-Boats now
arrived, and being guided by the Noise, reinforced their Companions, put
the Traytors to Flight, and brought off their dead and wounded. The
_Europeans_ lost by this Treachery seven slain outright, and eight
wounded, six of which recovered.

The Crew were resolved to revenge the Blood of their Officers and
Comrades the next Day, and were accordingly on the Point of Landing,
when two Canoes came off with two Men bound, the pretended Authors of
this Treason, without the King's Knowledge, who had sent 'em that they
might receive the Punishment due to their Villany. The _Johanna_ Men on
Board were call'd for Interpreters, who having given this Account,
added, that the King only sacrificed these Men, but that they should not
believe him, for he certainly had given Orders for assassinating the
_Europeans_; and the better Way was to kill all the _Mohilians_ that
came in the Canoes as well as the two Prisoners; go back to _Johanna_,
take more of their Countrymen, and give no Peace to Traytors; but
_Misson_ was for no such violent Measures, he was averse to every Thing
that bore the Face of Cruelty and thought a bloody Revenge, if Necessity
did not enforce it, spoke a groveling and timid Soul; he, therefore,
sent those of the Canoes back, and bid them tell their King, if before
the Evening he sent the Hostages agreed upon, he should give Credit to
his Excuse, but if he did not, he should believe him the Author of the
late vile Attempt on his Life.

The Canoes went off but returned not with an Answer, wherefore, he bid
the _Johanna_ Men tell the two Prisoners that they should be set on
Shore the next Morning, and order'd them to acquaint their King, he was
no Executioner to put those to Death whom he had condemn'd, but that he
should find, he knew how to revenge himself of his Treason. The
Prisoners being unbound, threw themselves at his Feet, and begg'd that
he would not send them ashore, for they should be surely put to Death,
for the Crime they had committed, was, the dissuading the barbarous
Action of which they were accused as Authors.

Next Day the two Ships landed 200 Men, under the Cover of their Canon;
but that Precaution of bringing their Ships close to the Shore they
found needless; not a Soul appearing, they march'd two Leagues up the
Country, when they saw a Body of Men appear behind some Shrubs;
_Caraccioli_'s Lieutenant, who commanded the right Wing, with fifty Men
made up to them, but found he had got among Pit Falls artificially
cover'd, several of his Men falling into them, which made him halt, and
not pursue those _Mohilians_ who made a feint Retreat to ensnare him,
thinking it dangerous to proceed farther; and seeing no Enemy would face
them, they retired the same Way they came, and getting into their Boats,
went on Board the Ships, resolving to return with a strong
Reinforcement, and make Descents at one and the same Time in different
Parts of the Island. They ask'd the two Prisoners how the Country lay,
and what the Soil was on the North Side the Island; and they answer'd it
was morass, and the most dangerous Part to attempt, it being a Place
where they shelter on any imminent Danger.

The Ships return'd to _Johanna_, where the greatest Tenderness and Care
was shewn for the Recovery and Cure of the two Captains and of their
Men; they lay six Weeks before they were able to walk the Decks, for
neither of them would quit his Ship. Their _Johanna_ Wives expressed a
Concern they did not think them capable of, nay, a Wife of one of the
wounded Men who died, stood some Time looking upon the Corpse as
motionless as a Statue, then embracing it, without shedding a Tear,
desired she might take it ashore to wash and bury it; and at the same
Time, by an Interpreter, and with a little Mixture of _European_
Language, she had, begg'd her late Husband's Friends would take their
Leave of him the next Day.

Accordingly a Number went ashore, and carried with them the Dividend,
which fell to his Share, which the Captain order'd to be given his
Widow; when she saw the Money, she smil'd, and ask'd if all, all that
was for her? Being answered in the affirmative, and what Good will all
that shining Dirt do me, if I could with it purchase the Life of my
Husband, and call him back from the Grave, I would accept it with
Pleasure, but as it is not sufficient to allure him back to this World,
I have no Use for it; do with it what you please. Then she desired they
would go with her and perform the last Ceremonies to her Husband's dead
Body, after their Country Fashion, least he should be displeased, that
she could not stay with them, to be a Witness, because she was in haste
to go and be married again. She startled the _Europeans_ who heard this
latter Part of her Speech so dissonant from the Beginning; however, they
followed her, and she led them into a Plantane Walk, where they found a
great many _Johanna_ Men and Women, sitting under the Shade of
Plantanes, round the Corpse, which lay (as they all sate) on the Ground,
covered with Flowers. She embraced them round, and then the _Europeans_,
one by one, and after these Ceremonies, she poured out a Number of
bitter Imprecations against the _Mohila_ Men, whose Treachery had
darken'd her Husband's Eyes, and made him insensible of her Caresses,
who was her first Love, to whom she had given her Heart, with her
Virginity. She then proceeded in his Praises, calling him the Joy of
Infants, the Love of Virgins, the Delight of the old, and the Wonder of
the young, adding, he was strong and beautiful as the Cedar, brave as
the Bull, tender as the Kid, and loving as the Ground Turtle; having
finished this Oration, not unlike those of the _Romans_, which the
nearest Relation of the deceas'd used to pronounce from the Rostrum, she
laid her down by the Side of her Husband, embracing him, and sitting up
again, gave herself a deep Wound under the left Breast with a Bayonet,
and fell dead on her Husband's Corpse.

The _Europeans_ were astonished at the Tenderness and Resolution of the
Girl, for she was not, by what her Mien spoke her, past seventeen; and
they now admired, as much as they had secretly detested her, for saying
she was in haste to be married again, the Meaning of which they did not
understand.

After the Husband and Wife were buried, the Crew return'd on Board, and
gave an Account of what had pass'd; the Captains Wives (for _Misson_ and
his were on Board the _Bijoux_, the Name they had given their Prize from
her Make and Gilding) seem'd not in the least surprized, and
_Caraccioli_'s Lady only said, she must be of noble Descent, for none
but the Families of the Nobility had the Privilege allowed them of
following their Husbands, on pain, if they transgressed, of being thrown
into the Sea, to be eat by Fish; and they knew, that their Souls could
not rest as long as any of the Fish, who fed upon them, lived. _Misson_
asked, if they intended to have done the same Thing had they died? We
should not, answer'd his Wife, have disgraced our Families; nor is our
Tenderness for our Husbands inferior to hers whom you seem to admire.

After their Recovery, _Misson_ proposed a Cruize, on the Coast of
_Zangueber_, which being agreed to, he and _Caraccioli_ took Leave of
the Queen and her Brother, and would have left their Wives on the
Island, but they could by no Means be induced to the Separation; it was
in vain to urge the Shortness of the Time they were to Cruize; they
answer'd it was farther than _Mohila_ they intended to go, and if they
were miserable in that short Absence, they could never support a longer;
and if they would not allow them to keep them Company the Voyage, they
must not expect to see them at their Return, if they intended one.

In a Word they were obliged to yield to them, but told them, if the
Wives of their Men should insist as strongly on following their Example,
their Tenderness, would be their Ruin, and make them a Prey to their
Enemies; they answer'd the Queen should prevent that, by ordering no
Woman should go on Board, and if any were in the Ships, they should
return on Shore: This Order was accordingly made, and they set Sail for
the River of _Mozembique_. In about ten Days Cruize after they had left
_Johanna_, and about 15 Leagues to the Eastward of this River, they fell
in with a stout _Portuguese_ Ship of 60 Guns, which engaged them from
Break of Day till Two in the Afternoon, when the Captain being killed,
and a great Number of Men lost, she struck: This proved a very rich
Prize, for she had the Value of 250000 l. Sterling on Board, in
Gold-Dust. The two Women never quitted the Decks all the Time of the
Engagement, neither gave they the least Mark of Fear, except for their
Husbands: This Engagement cost them thirty Men, and _Caraccioli_ lost
his right Leg; the Slaughter fell mostly on the _English_, for of the
above Number, twenty were of that Nation: The _Portuguese_ lost double
the Number. _Caraccioli_'s Wound made them resolve to make the best of
their Way for _Johanna_, where the greatest Care was taken of their
wounded, not one of whom died, tho' their Number amounted to Twenty
seven.

_Caraccioli_ kept his Bed two Months, but _Misson_ seeing him in a fair
way of Recovery, took what Hands could be spar'd from the _Bijoux_,
leaving her sufficient for Defence, and went out, having mounted ten of
the _Portuguese_ Guns, for he had hitherto carried but thirty, though he
had Ports for forty. He stretched over to _Madagascar_, and coasted
along this Island to the Northward, as far as the most northerly Point,
when turning back, he enter'd a Bay to the northward of _Diego Suares_.
He run ten Leagues up this Bay, and on the larboard Side found it
afforded a large, and safe, Harbour, with plenty of fresh Water. He came
here to an Anchor, went ashore and examined into the Nature of the Soil,
which he found rich, the Air wholesome, and the Country level. He told
his Men, that this was an excellent Place for an Asylum, and that he
determined here to fortify and raise a small Town, and make Docks for
Shipping, that they might have some Place to call their own; and a
Receptacle, when Age or Wounds had render'd them incapable of Hardship,
where they might enjoy the Fruits of their Labour, and go to their
Graves in Peace. That he would not, however, set about this, till he had
the Approbation of the whole Company; and were he sure they would all
approve this Design, which he hoped, it being evidently for the general
Good, he should not think it adviseable to begin any Works, lest the
Natives should, in his Absence, destroy them; but however, as they had
nothing upon their Hands, if they were of his Opinion, they might begin
to fall and square Timber, ready for the raising a wooden Fort, when
they return'd with their Companions.

The Captain's Motion was universally applauded, and in ten Days they
fell'd and rough hew'd a hundred and fifty large Trees, without any
Interruption from, or seeing any of, the Inhabitants. They fell'd their
Timber at the Waters Edge, so that they had not the Trouble of hawling
them any way, which would have employ'd a great deal more Time: They
returned again, and acquainted their Companions with what they had seen
and done, and with the Captain's Resolution, which they one and all came
into.

Captain _Misson_ then told the Queen, as he had been serviceable to her
in her War with the Island of _Mohila_, and might continue to be of
farther Use, he did not question her lending him Assistance in the
settling himself on the Coast of _Madagascar_, and to that end, furnish
him with 300 Men, to help in his Buildings; the Queen answered, she
could do nothing without Consent of Council, and that she would assemble
her Nobility, and did not question their agreeing to any Thing he could
reasonably desire, for they were sensible of the Obligations the
_Johannians_ had to him. The Council was accordingly called, and
_Misson_'s Demand being told, one of the eldest said, he did not think
it expedient to comply with it, nor safe to refuse; that they should in
agreeing to give him that Assistance, help to raise a Power, which might
prove formidable to themselves, by the being so near a Neighbour; and
these Men who had lately protected, might, when they found it for their
Interest, enslave them. On the other hand, if they did not comply, they
had the Power to do them great Damage. That they were to make choice of
the least of two possible Evils, for he could prognosticate no Good to
_Johanna_, by their settling near it. Another answered, that many of
them had _Johanna_ Wives, that it was not likely they would make Enemies
of the _Johanna_ Men at first settling, because their Friendship might
be of Use to them; and from their Children there was nothing to be
apprehended in the next Generation, for they would be half their own
Blood; that in the mean while, if they comply'd with the Request, they
might be sure of an Ally, and Protector, against the King of _Mohila_;
wherefore, he was for agreeing to the Demand.

After a long Debate, in which every Inconvenience, and Advantage, was
maturely considered, it was agreed to send with him the Number of Men he
required, on Condition he should send them back in four Moons, make an
Alliance with them, and War against _Mohila_; this being agreed to, they
staid till _Caraccioli_ was thoroughly recovered, then putting the
_Johannians_ on board the _Portuguese_ Ship with 40 _French_ and
_English_ and 15 _Portuguese_ to work her, and setting Sail, they
arrived at the Place where _Misson_ designed his Settlement, which he
called _Libertalia_, and gave the Name of _Liberi_ to his People,
desiring in that might be drown'd the distinguish'd Names of _French_,
_English_, _Dutch_, _Africans_, &c.

The first Thing they sat about was, the raising a Fort on each Side the
Harbour, which they made of an octogon Figure, and having finished and
mounted them with 40 Guns taken out of the _Portuguese_, they raised a
Battery on an Angle of ten Guns, and began to raise Houses and Magazines
under the Protection of their Forts and Ships; the _Portuguese_ was
unrigg'd, and all her Sails and Cordage carefully laid up. While they
were very busily employed in the raising a Town, a Party which had often
hunted and rambled four or five Leagues off their Settlement, resolved
to venture farther into the Country. They made themselves some Huts, at
about 4 Leagues distance from their Companions, and travell'd East South
East, about 5 Leagues farther into the Country, when they came up with a
Black, who was arm'd with a Bow, Arrows, and a Javelin; they with a
friendly Appearance engaged the Fellow to lay by his Fear and go with
them. They carried him to their Companions, and there entertained him
three Days with a great Deal of Humanity, and then returned with him
near the Place they found him, made him a Present of a Piece of scarlet
Baze, and an Ax; he appeared overjoy'd at the Present, and left them
with seeming Satisfaction.

The Hunters imagined that there might be some Village not far off, and
observing that he look'd at the Sun, and then took his Way direct South,
they travell'd on the same Point of the Compass, and from the Top of a
Hill they spied a pretty large Village, and went down to it; the Men
came out with their Arms, such as before described, Bows, Arrows, and
Javelins, but upon two only of the Whites advancing, with Presents of
Axes, and Baze in their Hands, they sent only four to meet them. The
Misfortune was, that they could not understand one another, but by their
pointing to the Sun, and holding up one Finger, and making one of them
go forward, and return again with shewing their Circumcision, and
pointing up to Heaven with one Finger, they apprehended, they gave them
to understand, there was but one God, who had sent one Prophet, and
concluded from thence, and their Circumcision they were _Mahometans_;
the Presents were carried to their Chief, and he seem'd to receive them
kindly, and by Signs invited the Whites into their Village; but they,
remembring the late Treachery of the _Mohilians_, made Signs for
Victuals to be brought them where they were.

_More of the History of these Adventurers in another Place._


                                   OF
                          Capt. _JOHN BOWEN_.

The exact Time of this Person's setting out I am not certain of; I find
him cruising on the _Mallabar_ Coast in the Year 1700, commanding a Ship
called the _Speaker_, whose Crew consisted of Men of all Nations, and
their Pyracies were committed upon Ships of all Nations likewise. The
Pyrates here met with no Manner of Inconveniencies in carrying on their
Designs, for it was made so much a Trade, that the Merchants of one Town
never scrupled the buying Commodities taken from another, though but ten
Miles distant, in a publick Sale, furnishing the Robbers at the same
Time with all Necessaries, even of Vessels, when they had Occasion to go
on any Expedition, which they themselves would often advise them of.

Among the rest an _English East-India_ Man, Captain _Coneway_ from
_Bengal_, fell into the Hands of this Crew, which they made Prize of,
near _Callequilon_; they carried her in, and put her up to sale,
dividing the Ship and Cargoe into three Shares; one Third was sold to a
Merchant, Native of _Callequilon_ aforesaid, another Third to a Merchant
of _Porca_, and the other to one _Malpa_, a _Dutch_ Factor.

Loaded with the Spoil of this and several Country Ships, they left the
Coast, and steer'd for _Madagascar_; but in their Voyage thither,
meeting with adverse Winds, and, being negligent in their Steerage, they
ran upon St. _Thomas_'s Reef, at the Island of _Mauritius_, where the
Ship was lost; but _Bowen_ and the greatest Part of the Crew got safe
ashore.

They met here with all the Civility and good Treatment imaginable;
_Bowen_ was complimented in a particular Manner by the Governor, and
splendidly entertained in his House; the sick Men were got, with great
Care, into the Fort, and cured by their Doctor, and no Supplies of any
sort wanting for the rest. They spent here three Months, but yet
resolving to set down at _Madagascar_, they bought a Sloop, which they
converted into a Brigantine, and, about the middle of _March_ 1701,
departed, having first taken formal Leave of the Governor, by making a
Present of 2500 Pieces of Eight, leaving him, besides, the Wreck of
their Ship, with the Guns, Stores, and every Thing else that was saved.
The Governor, on his Part, supply'd them with Necessaries for their
Voyage, which was but short, and gave them a kind Invitation to make
that Island a Place of Refreshment in the Course of their future
Adventures, promising that nothing should be wanting to them that his
Government afforded.

Upon their Arrival at _Madagascar_, they put in at a Place on the
East-Side, called _Maritan_, quitted their Vessel, and settled
themselves ashore in a fruitful Plain on the Side of a River. They built
themselves a Fort on the River's Mouth towards the Sea, and another
small one on the other Side towards the Country; the first to prevent a
Surprize from Shipping, and the other as a Security from the Natives,
many of whom they employed in the Building. They built also a little
Town for their Habitation, which took up the Remainder of the Year 1701.

When this was done, they soon became dissatisfied with their new
Situation, having a hankering Mind after their old Employment, and
accordingly resolved to fit up the Brigantine they had from the _Dutch_
at _Mauritius_, which was laid in a Cove near their Settlement, but an
Accident, that they improved, provided for them in a better Manner, and
saved them a great deal of Trouble.

It happened that about the beginning of the Year 1702, a Ship called the
_Speedy Return_, belonging to the _Scotch-African_ and _East-India_
Company, Captain _Drummond_ Commander, came into the Port of _Maritan_
in _Madagascar_, with a Brigantine that belonged to her; they had before
taken in Negroes at St. _Mary_'s, a little Island adjoining to the main
Island of _Madagascar_, and carried them to Don _Mascarenhas_, from
whence they sailed to this Port on the same Trade.

On the Ship's Arrival, Captain _Drummond_, with _Andrew Wilky_, his
Surgeon, and several others of the Crew, went on Shore; in the mean
while _John Bowen_, with four others of his Consorts, goes off in a
little Boat, on Pretence of buying some of their Merchandize brought
from _Europe_, and finding a fair Opportunity, the chief Mate,
Boatswain, and a Hand or two more only upon the Deck, and the rest at
Work in the Hold, they threw off their Mask; each drew out a Pistol and
Hanger, and told them, they were all dead Men if they did not retire
that Moment to the Cabin. The Surprize was sudden, and they thought it
necessary to obey; one of the Pyrates placed himself Centry at the Door,
with his Arms in his Hands, and the rest immediately laid the Hatches,
and then made a Signal to their Fellows on Shore, as agreed on; upon
which, about forty or fifty came on Board, and took quiet Possession of
the Ship, and afterwards the Brigantine, without Bloodshed, or striking
a Stroke.

_Bowen_ was made, or rather made himself, of Course, Captain; he
detained the old Crew, or the greatest Part thereof, burnt the
Brigantine as being of no Use to them, cleaned and fitted the Ship, took
Water, Provisions, and what Necessaries were wanting, and made ready for
new Adventures.

I shall leave them a while, to relate an unfortunate Story of a worthy
honest Gentleman, who suffered through the Rashness and Folly of a
headstrong People, for pyratically taking and murdering the Captain and
Crew of this very Ship _Bowen_ and his Gang now seized.

An _English-India_ Man, commanded by Captain _Thomas Green_, called the
_Worcester_, in her Voyage home to _England_, was drove by southerly
Winds into _Scotland_, in the Month of _July_ 1704, and anchored in
_Leith_ Road; the Captain, and several of the Ship's Company, going
ashore for Refreshments, the People of the Town, who had Acquaintance
and Friends in Captain _Drummond_'s Ship, understanding the _Worcester_
came from the _East-Indies_, were very importunate in their Enquiries
after this Ship, and being told that they had heard of no such Ship in
_India_, the Enquirers pretended to be very much surprized; so that, in
short, it grew into a Suspicion that the _Worcester_ had not dealt
fairly by the _Scotch_ Ship, which they had not heard of themselves
since her Departure. In short, the Magistrates were inform'd that some
of the Crew had dropt Words that plainly indicated the supposed Robbery
and Murders of their Countrymen. Upon this several Men were privately
examined; sometimes they were threaten'd to be hanged, and then again
large Promises were made to encourage 'em to discover the pretended
Fact; till at length an _Indian_ Boy was prevailed on to confess the
whole Matter upon Oath, as they might think. Then the Captain, chief
Mate and Crew, were seized and sent to Prison, the Ship was unloaded,
and almost ripp'd to Pieces, to search for Goods, Writings, _&c._ to
confirm the _Indian_'s Deposition, but nothing could be found; therefore
they were obliged to try them, and try them they did, upon this
Evidence, and some small Circumstances sworn to by _Charles May_, the
Surgeon, which carried great Improbabilities along with it. The
Depositions were as follow; the _Indian_, whose Name was _Antonio
Ferdinando_ swore, 'That on the Coast of _Mallabar_ he came aboard the
Sloop that attended the _Worcester_, and thereafter saw an Engagement
between the said Sloop, the _Worcester_ and another Ship, sailed by
White Men, speaking _English_, and bearing _English_ Colours. That they
did engage the said Ship for three Days, and on the third Day the said
Ship was boarded by those in the Sloop, who took up the Crew of the said
Ship from under Deck, killed them with Hatchets, and threw them
overboard.'

_Charles May_ only deposed, 'That being ashore at _Callequillon_ he
heard Guns firing at Sea, and asking some Body he met at the Landing
Place, what meant this shooting? He was answered, the _Worcester_ was
gone out, and was fighting at Sea with another Ship. That the next
Morning he saw the _Worcester_ riding at her Birth, where she had rid
the Day before, and another Ship riding at her Stern. That the
_Worcester_'s Long-Boat coming ashore, and he asking the Men what
brought them ashore? They answered, they were sent for Water, they
having spilt and staved all their Water; and that they had been busking
all Night. That _this Evidence_ going aboard five or six Days after, saw
the Ship lumber'd with Goods, and that he was inform'd that the Ship
that was riding at the _Worcester_'s Stern, was sold to _Cogo Comodo_,
Merchant at _Quilon_. That _Antonio Ferdinando_ was wounded, and some
others; and when he ask'd the Patients how they came by their Wounds,
they were forbid to answer by Mr. _Madder_, the chief Mate. That all
this fell out between the Months of _January_ and _February_ 1703.'

As to _Antonio_'s Deposition, it appear'd to be all Invention, and
nothing true in it; and _Charles May_'s a Heap of sly Insinuations,
drawn from a known Fact, which was this; the _Worcester_ departing from
_Callequillon_ to _Carnipole_, was drove by Stress of Weather from near
the Road of _Quillon_ to _Anjango_, where coming near the _Aureng Zeb_,
_India_ Man, she saluted her with five Guns, which were the Guns the
Surgeon heard; and the _Aureng Zeb_ came in along with the _Worcester_,
and anchor'd at her Stern, which was the Ship taken Notice of by him. By
busking all Night is meant only beating to Windward, which she did in
order to fetch _Quillon_, the Wind being contrary. The _Worcester_
spar'd her Water to the _Aureng Zeb_, which occasioned their sending for
more, and the wounded Men, which were proved to be no more than three in
the Voyage; one was from a Fall in the Hold, another by fighting with
Knives, between two _Dutch_ Men, and the other by cutting of Wood.

'Tis observable likewise, that _May_'s Evidence, which is brought to
support _Antonio_'s, contradicted it in several Parts; for _Antonio_
swore the Fact to be done between _Callicut_ and _Tallecherry_, (where,
by the Way, the Ship never was, as was own'd by the Surgeon, and prov'd
by the Captain's and other Journals) and _May_ heard the Guns at
_Callequillon_, which could not be less then 140 Miles asunder.
_Antonio_ makes the supposed Engagement hold three Days; according to
_May_, the _Worcester_ was busking only one Night; all the rest of his
Evidence is, _As he was inform'd_, _As he was told_, &c. And what's
remarkable of this _May_, is, he was eighteen Months after this in the
said Ship, and own'd on the Trial, that he never heard in all that Time
one Word spoken of a Fight with any other Ship, or a Prize taken, or any
Thing relating to such an Action, which must be very strange, if the
Matter had been true.

In short, Captain _Green_ and the rest of the Crew were convicted, and
received Sentence for the supposed Crimes, as follows, _Green_,
_Madder_, _Sympson_, _Keigle_ and _Haines_ to be hanged on _Wednesday,
April_ 4th. _Taylor_, _Glenn_, _Kitchen_ and _Robertson_, on _Wednesday,
April_ 11th, and _Brown_, _Bruckley_, _Wilcocks_, _Ballantyne_ and
_Linsey_, on _Wednesday, April_ 18th.

I cannot but here take Notice (though with much Concern) that upon the
Condemnation of these unhappy Men, there seemed a universal Joy in and
about the City; it was the only Discourse for some Days, and every Man
thought himself nearly concerned in it; and some could not forbear in
Words openly to express their brutal Joy: Now, said they, we'll _Darien_
'em: By this they shall see we'll do our selves Justice, _&c_.

After Sentence, the Prisoners desired not to be disturb'd in their dying
Moments, that they might improve 'em to the best Advantage; but now they
were not only insulted with the most opprobrious Language, by such as
could get to 'em, but continually worried by the religious Kirk
Teachers. The most dismal Threatnings were denounc'd against 'em, and
nothing but God's Wrath and eternal Torments in all its Horrors, were to
be their Portion, if they died obdurate (as they call'd it) that is,
without owning themselves guilty; and all this delivered with that
Passion peculiar to that bitter Sett of Men. Nay, so restless were they,
that even now, after Condemnation, they singled out some they found more
terrified by their Cant, and assur'd 'em of Life if they would
ingenuously acknowledge the Crimes they were condemned for; and, at
last, worked so far upon _Haines_ and _Linsey_, that they brought them
to own almost what they pleased. The former of these, upon their Pardons
being granted, gave a frightful Account of the whole Pyracy and Murther
upon _Drummond_'s Ship, and took Care, as near as he could, to keep
close with _Ferdinando_'s Evidence, only here and there he was out in
very material Points, as Men always are that don't relate Matters of
Fact. There was a great many bloody Circumstances added to colour the
whole, as their Manner of Swearing when they commenced Pyrates (much
like the ridiculous Ceremonies at making of Witches) which, he said, was
thus; Every one of 'em was let Blood, which they mixed together, and
after every Man had drank part, they all swore to Secrecy, _&c._ with
abundance of such Stuff. _Linsey_, a Man of better Sense, contented
himself with saying as little as possible, which was excusable, he being
on shoar in the pretended Engagement, so that most of what he said,
consisted in Hearsays of the _Indians_, _&c._ Thus these poor Wretches
screen'd themselves from this fatal Blow, at the Expence of Faith and a
good Conscience, and to enjoy a troublesome Life, perhaps a few Years.

As soon as their Confessions were made publick, the Gentry, as well as
the Mob, was transported with Rage, and the poor Wretches were blackened
and reviled in a shameful Manner; and so violent was the Torrent of
their Fury, that it reached even their Council for their Tryals, and
they were obliged, for their own Safety, to withdraw into the Country.

In the midst of this Confusion two Men, who were known to be of
_Drummond_'s Crew, came home in the _Raper_ Galley, and made Affidavits
of the Loss of the said Ship to the Pyrates, as has been mentioned; upon
which her Majesty and Council first reprieved them for eight Days, and
afterwards desired Execution might be farther respited till they heard
from above.

The common People, who for some Time past, with raised Expectations, had
waited for the Execution, began to grow very impatient, bitterly
inveighing against the Reprieve; and the Council met on the 11th of
_April_ in the Morning, to consider what was to be done; which the Mob
perceiving, imagined 'twas in order to a further Reprieve or Pardon;
immediately all Shops were shut up, and the Streets filled with
incredible Numbers of Men, Women and Children, calling for Justice upon
those _English_ Murtherers. The Lord Chancellour _Seafield_'s Coach
happening to pass by, they stopp'd it, broke the Sashes, haul'd him out,
and oblig'd him to promise Execution should speedily be done before he
could get from 'em.

According to the Chancellor's Promise, soon after, on the same Day,
being _Wednesday_, Captain _Green_, _Madder_, and _Sympson_ were brought
out, and convey'd to Execution, which was at _Leith Road_ upon the
Sands, and all the Way were huzza'd in triumph as it were, and insulted
with the sharpest and most bitter Invectives.

Thus fell these unhappy Men a well-pleasing Sacrifice to the Malice of
wicked Men.

As for Captain _Green_'s Speech; after he had taken Notice of the Crimes
he was to dye for, and appealed to all present to charge him, or the
Crew, with any Injustice, since he had lived there; he goes on in giving
an Account of his Faith, his living and dying in the Church of
_England_, of their Manner of Life abroad, their Observance of religious
Duties, and the Sense he had of the Impossibility of Salvation, if he
dy'd with a Falshood in his Mouth. Then follows,--'Pursuant to which, I
in the Presence of Almighty God, declare to you his People, that I am
innocent in Design or Deed, and free from the Crimes for which I am
condemned. That to my Knowledge, I never all my Life-time wrong'd Man in
his Person or Goods, or had Accession thereto. What the Custom of
Pyrates is, I thank God I know not: But I understand my Accusers and
Persecuters will have you to believe, that I think it unnecessary to
confess before Men. Take what I say as good Christians ought to do; if
you have no Charity, you wrong your selves, and cannot hurt me.'

'I am told some of my Crew have confess'd the Crimes, and load us with
Guilt; this is done since Sentence, and in hopes of saving themselves,
which I wish they may do by lawful Means, and not have Accession to the
shedding innocent Blood. I am a dying, these are still in hopes to live,
chuse you which of us to believe, _&c._'

To return to Captain _Bowen_, who pyratically possessed himself of
Captain _Drummond_'s Ship and Brigantine, as aforesaid, he, being
inform'd by the Crew, that when they left Don _Mascarenhas_, a Ship
called the _Rook_ Galley, Captain _Honeycomb_ Commander, was lying in
that Bay, resolved, with the other Pyrates, to sail thither, but it
taking up seven or eight Days in watering their Vessels, and settling
their private Affairs, they arrived not at the Island till after the
Departure of the said Galley, who thereby happily escaped the villainous
Snare of their unprovok'd Enemies.

The Night after the Pyrates left _Maritan_, the Brigantine ran on a
Ledge of Rocks off the West Side of the Island _Madagascar_, which not
being perceived by the Ship, _Bowen_ came into _Mascarenhas_ without
her, not knowing what was become of his Consort.

Here Captain _Bowen_ staid eight or ten Days, in which Time he supplied
the Ship with Provisions, and judging, that the _Rook_ Galley was gone
to some other Island, the Ship sail'd to _Mauritius_, in search of her;
but the Pyrates seeing four or five Ships in the N. W. Harbour, they
thought themselves too weak to attempt any thing there, so they stood
immediately for _Madagascar_ again, and arrived safe, first to _Port
Dauphin_, and then to _Augustin Bay_. In a few Days the _Content_
Brigantine, which they supposed either to have been lost, or revolted
that honourable Service, came into the same Bay, and informed their
Brethren of the Misfortune that happened to them: The Rogues were glad,
no doubt, of seeing one another again, and calling a Council together,
they found the Brigantine in no Condition for Business, being then very
leaky, therefore she was condemned, and forthwith halled ashore and
burnt, and the Crew united, and all went aboard the _Speedy Return_.

At this Place the Pyrates were made acquainted, by the Negroes, of the
Adventures of another Gang that had settled for some Time near that
Harbour, and had one _Howard_ for their Captain. It was the Misfortune
of an _India_ Ship called the _Prosperous_, to come into the Bay at a
Time that these Rogues were looking out for Employment; who, under the
Pretence of trading (almost in the same Manner that _Bowen_ and his Gang
had seized the _Speedy Return_) made themselves Masters of her, and
sailed with her to _New Mathelage_. _Bowen_ and his Gang consulting
together on this Intelligence, concluded 'twas more for their Interest
to join in Alliance with this new Company, than to act single, they
being too weak of themselves to undertake any considerable Enterprize,
remembring how they were obliged to bear away from the Island of
_Mauritius_, when they were in search of the _Rook_ Gally, which they
might have taken, with several others, had they had at that Time a
Consort of equal Force to their own Ship.

They accordingly set sail from the Bay, and came into _New Mathelage_,
but found no Ship there, tho' upon Enquiry they understood that the
Pyrate they look'd for, had been at the Place, but was gone; so after
some Stay they proceeded to _Johanna_, but the _Prosperous_ not being
there neither, they sailed to _Mayotta_, where they found her lying at
Anchor; this was about _Christmas_ 1702.

Here these two Powers struck up an Alliance, _Howard_ liking the
Proposals, came readily into it, and the Treaty was ratified by both
Companies. They staid above two Months at this Island, thinking it,
perhaps, as likely a Place to meet with Prey as cruising out for it, and
so indeed it happened; for about the beginning of _March_, the Ship
_Pembroke_ belonging to our _East-India_ Company, coming in for Water,
was boarded by their Boats, and taken, with the Loss of the chief Mate
and another Man that were killed in the Skirmish.

The two Pyrate Ships weighed, and went out to Sea along with their
Prize, and that Day and the next plundered her of the best Part of her
Cargo, Provisions and Stores, and then taking the Captain and Carpenter
away, they let the _Pembroke_ go where the Remainder of her Crew
pleased, and came with their Ships into _New Methelage_. Here the two
Captains consulted, and laid a Plan for a Cruize to _India_, for which
Purpose they detained Captain _Woolley_ of the _Pembroke_ lately taken,
in order to be their Pilot in those Seas; but a very hot Dispute arose
between the two Companies, which Ship he should go aboard of, insomuch
that they had gone together by the Ears, if an Expedient had not been
found to satisfy each Party, that one might not have the Advantage of
the other by the Captain's Skill and Knowledge of the _Indian_ Coast,
and this was to knock the poor Man on the Head; and murder him; but at
last, by the Authority of _Bowen_, Captain _Woolley_ escaped the
threaten'd Danger, by bringing his Company to consent to his remaining
on board the _Prosperous_, where he then was.

The _Speedy Return_ being foul, and wanting a little Repair, it was
judged proper for her to go back to _Augustin_ Bay to clean; in the mean
while the _Prosperous_ was to have a Pair of Boot-Tops where she lay,
and likewise to take in Water and Provision, and then to join their
Consort again at _Mayotta_, the Island appointed for the Rendezvous.

The _Prosperous_ put into _Mayotta_ as agreed on, and waiting there some
Time for _Bowen_'s Ship, without seeing or hearing any News of her, went
to _Johanna_, but not meeting with her there, they apprehended some
Accident had befel her, and therefore left the Place, and sailed on the
Expedition themselves. As to the _Speedy Return_, she arrived safe at
St. _Augustin_'s Bay at _Madagascar_, and there cleaned and victualled;
but tarrying there somewhat too long, the Winds hung contrary, and they
could not for their Lives beat up to _Mayotta_, and therefore went to
_Johanna_, where, hearing that their Friends had lately left that
Island, they steered for the _Red Sea_, but the Wind not proving fair
for their Design, they bore away for the High Land of St. _John_'s, near
_Surrat_, where they once more fell in Company with their Brethren of
the _Prosperous_.

They cruiz'd together, as was first agreed on, and after some Time they
had Sight of four Ships, to whom they gave Chace; but these separating,
two standing to Northward, and two to the Southward, the Pyrates
separated likewise, _Bowen_ standing after those that steered Southerly,
and _Howard_ crowded after the others. _Bowen_ came up with the heaviest
of the two, which proved to be a _Moorish_ Ship of 700 Tun, bound from
the Gulph of _Mocha_ to _Surat_. The Pyrates brought the Prize into
_Rajapora_, on the Coast of _India_, where they plundered her; the
Merchandize they sold to the Natives, but a small Sum of current Gold
they found aboard, amounting to 22,000 _l._ _English_ Money, they put
into their Pockets. Two Days after the _Prosperous_ came in, but without
any Prize; however, they soon made their Friends acquainted that they
had not succeeded worse than themselves, for at _Surat_ River's Mouth,
where all the four Ships were bound, they came up with their Chace; and
with a Broadside, one of them struck, but the other got into the Bay.
They stood down the Coast with the Prize till they had plundered her of
the best of her Cargoe, the most valuable of which was 84,000
_Chequins_, a Piece of about ten Shillings each, and then they left her
adrift, without either Anchor or Cable, off _Daman_.

While they were lying at _Rajapora_ they past a Survey on their
Shipping, and judging their own to be less serviceable than their Prize,
they voted them to the Flames, and straightway fitted up the _Surat_
Ship; they transported both Companies aboard of her, and then set Fire
to the _Prosperous_ and _Speedy Return_. They mustered at this Place 164
fighting Men, 43 only were _English_, the greater Number _French_, the
rest _Danes_, _Swedes_ and _Dutch_; they took aboard 70 _Indians_ to do
the Drudgery of the Ship, and mounted 56 Guns, calling her the
_Defiance_, and sailed from _Rajapora_ the latter End of _October_, in
the Year 1703, to cruize on the Coast of _Mallabar_:

But not meeting with Prey in this first Cruise, they came to an Anchor
about three Leagues to the Northward of _Cochen_, expecting some Boats
to come off with Supplies of Refreshments, for which Purpose they fired
several Guns, by way of Signal, but none appearing, the Quarter-Master
was sent in the Pinnace to confer with the People, which he did with
some Caution, keeping the Boat upon their Oars at the Shore-Side: In
short, they agreed very well, the Pyrates were promised whatever
Necessaries they wanted, and the Boat returned aboard.

The next Day a Boat came off from the Town with Hogs, Goats, Wine, _&c._
with a private Intimation from _Malpa_, the _Dutch_ Broker, an old
Friend of the Pyrates, that a Ship of that Country called the _Rimæ_,
lay then in _Mudbay_, not many Leagues off, and if they would go out and
take her, he would purchase the Cargo of them, and likewise promised
that they should be further supplied with Pitch, Tar, and all other
Necessaries, which was made good to them; for People from the Factory
flocked aboard every Hour, and dealt with them as in open Market, for
all Sorts of Merchandize, Refreshments, Jewels and Plate, returning with
Coffers of Money, _&c._ to a great Value.

The Advice of the Ship was taken very kindly, but the Pyrates judging
their own Ship too large to go close into the Bay, consulted their
Friend upon Means for taking the said Ship, who readily treated with
them for the Sale of one of less Burthen that lay then in the Harbour;
but _Malpa_ speaking to one _Punt_ of the Factory to carry her out, he
not only refused to be concerned in such a Piece of Villainy, but
reproved _Malpa_ for corresponding with the Pyrates, and told him, if he
should be guilty of so base an Action, he must never see the Face of any
of his Countrymen more; which made the honest Broker change both his
Countenance and his Purpose.

At this Place Captain _Woolley_, whom they had taken for their Pilot on
the _India_ Coast, being in a very sick and weak Condition, was, at his
earnest Intreaty, discharged from his severe Confinement among them, and
set ashore, and the next Day the Pyrates sailed, and ranged along the
_Mallabar_ Coast, in quest of more Booty. In their Way they met a second
time with the _Pembroke_, and plundered her of some Sugar, and other
small Things, and let her go again. From the Coast they sail'd back for
the Island of _Mauritius_, where they lay some Time, and lived after
their usual extravagant Manner.

At _Mauritius_ two of the Crew, _viz._ _Israel Phipeny_ and _Peter
Freeland_, left the Pyrates and concealed themselves in the Island till
the Ship sailed. These two Men were part of _Drummond_'s Crew, who found
an Opportunity of coming to _England_ soon after on board the _Raper_
Galley, and arrived at _Portsmouth_ in _March_ 1725. When this came to
be known, Mr. _John Green_, Brother to Capt. _Green_, then under
Sentence, went thither and got the Affidavits of the said _Phipeny_ and
_Freeland_, made before the Mayor of _Portsmouth_, containing several
Matters herein mentioned, which Affidavits were immediately brought to
_London_, and by the Secretary of State sent away Express to _Scotland_,
which arrived there some Hours before Capt. _Green_ was executed.


                                   OF
                          Capt. _WILLIAM KID_.

We are now going to give an Account of one whose Name is better known in
_England_, than most of those whose Histories we have already related;
the Person we mean is Captain _Kid_, whose publick Trial and Execution
here, rendered him the Subject of all Conversation, so that his Actions
have been chanted about in Ballads; however, it is now a considerable
Time since these Things passed, and though the People knew in general
that Captain _Kid_ was hanged, and that his Crime was Pyracy, yet there
were scarce any, even at that Time, who were acquainted with his Life or
Actions, or could account for his turning Pyrate.

In the Beginning of King _William_'s War, Captain _Kid_ commanded a
Privateer in the _West-Indies_, and by several adventurous Actions
acquired the Reputation of a brave Man, as well as an experienced
Seaman. About this Time the Pyrates were very troublesome in those
Parts, wherefore Captain _Kid_ was recommended by the Lord _Bellamont_,
then Governor of _Barbadoes_, as well as by several other Persons, to
the Government here, as a Person very fit to be entrusted with the
Command of a Government Ship, and to be employed in cruising upon the
Pyrates, as knowing those Seas perfectly well, and being acquainted with
all their lurking Places; but what Reasons governed the Politicks of
those Times, I cannot tell, but this Proposal met with no Encouragement
here, though it is certain it would have been of great Consequence to
the Subject, our Merchants suffering incredible Damages by those
Robbers.

Upon this Neglect the Lord _Bellamont_ and some others, who knew what
great Captures had been made by the Pyrates, and what a prodigious
Wealth must be in their Possession, were tempted to fit out a Ship at
their own private Charge, and to give the Command of it to Captain
_Kid_; and, to give the Thing a greater Reputation, as well as to keep
their Seamen under the better Command, they procured the King's
Commission for the said Captain _Kid_, of which the following is an
exact Copy.

_William Rex_,

_'William_ the Third, by the Grace of God, King of _England_,
_Scotland_, _France_ and _Ireland_, Defender of the Faith, _&c._ To our
trusty and well beloved Captain _William Kid_, Commander of the Ship the
_Adventure_ Gally, or to any other the Commander of the same for the
Time being, GREETING; Whereas we are informed, that Captain _Thomas
Too_, _John Ireland_, Captain _Thomas Wake_, and Captain _William Maze_,
or _Mace_, and other Subjects, Natives or Inhabitants of _New-York_, and
elsewhere, in our Plantations in _America_, have associated themselves,
with divers others, wicked and ill disposed Persons, and do, against the
Law of Nations, commit many and great Pyracies, Robberies and
Depredations on the Seas upon the Parts of _America_, and in other
Parts, to the great Hinderance and Discouragement of Trade and
Navigation, and to the great Danger and Hurt of our loving Subjects, our
Allies, and all others, navigating the Seas upon their lawful Occasions.
Now KNOW YE, that we being desirous to prevent the aforesaid Mischiefs,
and, as much as in us lies, to bring the said Pyrates, Free Booters and
Sea Rovers to Justice, have thought fit, and do hereby give and grant to
the said _William Kid_ (to whom our Commissioners for exercising the
Office of Lord High Admiral of _England_, have granted a Commission as a
private Man of War, bearing Date the 11th Day of _December_ 1695), and
unto the Commander of the said Ship for the Time being, and unto the
Officers, Mariners, and others, which shall be under your Command, full
Power and Authority to apprehend, sieze, and take into your Custody as
well the said Captain _Thomas Too_, _John Ireland_, Captain _Thomas
Wake_, and Captain _William Maze_, or _Mace_, as all such Pyrates, Free
Booters and Sea Rovers, being either our Subjects, or of other Nations
associated with them, which you shall meet with upon the Seas, or Coasts
of _America_, or upon any other Seas or Coasts, with all their Ships and
Vessels; and all such Merchandizes, Money, Goods and Wares as shall be
found on Board, or with them, in Case they shall willingly yield
themselves; but if they will not yield without fighting, then you are by
Force to compel them to yield. And we do also require you to bring, or
cause to be brought, such Pyrates, Free Booters, or Sea Rovers, as you
shall seize, to a legal Tryal, to the End they may be proceeded against
according to the Law in such Cases. And we do hereby command all our
Officers, Ministers, and other our loving Subjects whatsover, to be
aiding and assisting to you in the Premisses. And we do hereby enjoin
you to keep an exact Journal of your Proceedings in the Execution of the
Premisses, and set down the Names of such Pyrates, and of their Officers
and Company, and the Names of such Ships and Vessels as you shall by
Vertue of these Presents take and seize, and the Quantities of Arms,
Ammunition, Provision and Lading of such Ships, and the true Value of
the same, as near as you judge. And we do hereby strictly charge and
command you as you will answer the contrary at your Peril, that you do
not, in any Manner, offend or molest our Friends or Allies, their Ships,
or Subjects, by Colour or Pretence of these Presents, or the Authority
thereby granted. In Witness whereof we have caused our Great Seal of
_England_ to be affix'd to these Presents. Given at our Court of
_Kensington_, the 26th Day of _January_ 1695, in the seventh Year of our
Reign.'

Captain _Kid_ had also another Commission, which was called a Commission
of Reprisals; for it being then War Time, this Commission was to justify
him in the taking of _French_ Merchant Ships, in Case he should meet
with any; but as this Commission is nothing to our present Purpose, we
shall not burthen the Readers with it.

With these two Commissions he sail'd out of _Plymouth_ in _May_ 1696, in
the _Adventure_ Gally of thirty Guns, and eighty Men; the Place he first
design'd for was _New-York_; in his Voyage thither he took a _French_
Banker, but this was no Act of Pyracy, he having a Commission for that
Purpose, as we have just observ'd.

When he arrived at _New York_ he put up Articles for engaging more
Hands, it being necessary to his Ships Crew, since he proposed to deal
with a desperate Enemy: The Terms he offered were, that every Man should
have a Share of what was taken, reserving for himself and Owners forty
Shares. Upon which Encouragement he soon increas'd his Company to a
hundred and fifty five Men.

With this Company he sail'd first for _Maderas_, where he took in Wine
and some other Necessaries; from thence he proceeded to _Bonavist_, one
of the _Cape de Verd Islands_, to furnish the Ship with Salt, and from
thence went immediately to St. _Jago_, another of the _Cape de Verd
Islands_, in order to stock himself with Provisions. When all this was
done, he bent his Course to _Madagascar_, the known Rendezvouz of
Pyrates; in his Way he fell in with Captain _Warren_, Commadore of three
Men of War; he acquainted them with his Design, kept them Company two or
three Days, and then leaving them, made the best Way for _Madagascar_,
where he arrived in _February_ 1696, just nine Months from his Departure
from _Plymouth_.

It happen'd that at this Time the Pyrate Ships were most of them out in
search of Prey; so that according to the best Intelligence Captain _Kid_
could get, there was not one of them at that Time about the Island,
wherefore having spent some Time in watering his Ship, and taking in
more Provisions, he thought of trying his Fortune on the Coast of
_Malabar_, where he arrived in the Month of _June_ following, four
Months from his reaching _Madagascar_. Hereabouts he made an
unsuccessful Cruize, touching sometimes at the Island of _Mahala_,
sometimes at that of _Joanna_, betwixt _Malabar_ and _Madagascar_: His
Provisions were every Day wasting, and his Ship began to want Repair;
wherefore, when he was at _Joanna_, he found Means of borrowing a Sum of
Money from some _French_ Men who had lost their Ship, but saved their
Effects, and with this he purchas'd Materials for putting his Ship in
good Repair.

It does not appear all this while that he had the least Design of
turning Pyrate; for near _Mahala_ and _Joanna_ both, he met with several
_Indian_ Ships richly laden, to which he did not offer the least
Violence, tho' he was strong enough to have done what he pleas'd with
them; and the first Outrage or Depredation I find he committed upon
Mankind, was after his repairing his Ship, and leaving _Joanna_; he
touch'd at a Place call'd _Mabbee_, upon the _Red Sea_, where he took
some _Guinnea_ Corn from the Natives, by Force.

After this he sail'd to _Bab_'s _Key_, a Place upon a little Island at
the Entrance of the _Red Sea_; here it was that he first began to open
himself to his Ship's Company, and let them understand that he intended
to change his Measures; for, happening to talk of the _Moca_ Fleet which
was to sail that Way, he said, _We have been unsuccessful hitherto, but
Courage, my Boys, we'll make our Fortunes out of this Fleet_: And
finding that none of them appear'd averse to it, he order'd a Boat out,
well mann'd, to go upon the Coast to make Discoveries, commanding them
to take a Prisoner and bring to him, or get Intelligence any Way they
could. The Boat return'd in a few Days, bringing him Word, that they saw
fourteen or fifteen Ships ready to sail, some with _English_, some with
_Dutch_, and some with _Moorish_ Colours.

We cannot account for this sudden Change in his Conduct, otherwise than
by supposing that he first meant well, while he had Hopes of making his
Fortune by taking of Pyrates; but now, weary of ill Success, and fearing
least his Owners, out of Humour at their great Expences, should dismiss
him, and he should want Employment, and be mark'd out for an unlucky
Man; rather, I say, than run the Hazard of Poverty, he resolved to do
his Business one Way, since he could not do it another.

He therefore order'd a Man continually to watch at the Mast Head, least
this Fleet should go by them; and about four Days after, towards
Evening, it appear'd in Sight, being convoy'd by one _English_ and one
_Dutch_ Man of War. _Kid_ soon fell in with them, and getting into the
midst of them, fir'd at a _Moorish_ Ship which was next him; but the Men
of War taking the Alarm, bore down upon _Kid_, and firing upon him,
obliged him to sheer off, he not being strong enough to contend with
them. Now he had begun Hostilities, he resolv'd to go on, and therefore
he went and cruis'd along the Coast of _Malabar_; the first Prize he met
was a small Vessel belonging to _Aden_, the Vessel was _Moorish_, and
the Owners were _Moorish_ Merchants, but the Master was an _English_
Man, his Name was _Parker_. _Kid_ forc'd him and a _Portugueze_ that was
call'd _Don Antonio_, which were all the _Europeans_ on Board, to take
on with them; the first he design'd as a Pilot, and the last as an
Interpreter. He also used the Men very cruelly, causing them to be
hoisted up by the Arms, and drubb'd with a naked Cutlash, to force them
to discover whether they had Money on Board, and where it lay; but as
they had neither Gold nor Silver on Board, he got nothing by his
Cruelty; however, he took from them a Bale of Pepper, and a Bale of
Coffee, and so let them go.

A little Time after he touch'd at _Carawar_, a Place upon the same
Coast, where, before he arrived, the News of what he had done to the
_Moorish_ Ship had reach'd them; for some of the _English_ Merchants
there had received an Account of it from the Owners, who corresponded
with them; wherefore, as soon as _Kid_ came in, he was suspected to be
the Person who committed this Pyracy; and one Mr. _Harvey_ and Mr.
_Mason_, two of the _English_ Factory, came on Board and ask'd for
_Parker_, and _Antonio_ the _Portuguese_; but _Kid_ deny'd that he knew
any such Persons, having secur'd them both in a private Place in the
Hold, where they were kept for seven or eight Days, that is, till _Kid_
sail'd from thence.

However, the Coast was alarm'd, and a _Portuguese_ Man of War was sent
out to cruize: _Kid_ met with her, and fought her about six Hours,
gallantly enough; but finding her too strong to be taken, he quitted
her; for he was able to run away from her when he would: Then he went to
a Place call'd _Porco_, where he water'd the Ship, and bought a Number
of Hogs of the Natives to victual his Company.

Soon after this, he came up with a _Moorish_ Ship, the Master whereof
was a _Dutch_ Man, call'd _Schipper Mitchel_, and chased her under
_French_ Colours, which they observing, hoisted _French_ Colours too:
When he came up with her, he hail'd her in _French_, and they having a
_French_ Man on Board, answer'd him in the same Language; upon which he
order'd them to send their Boat on Board; they were oblig'd to do so,
and having examin'd who they were, and from whence they came; he ask'd
the _French_ Man, who was a Passenger, if he had a _French_ Pass for
himself? The _French_ Man gave him to understand that he had. Then he
told the _French_ Man he must pass for Captain, and by G-d, says he, you
are the Captain: The _French_ Man durst not refuse doing as he would
have him: The Meaning of this was, that he would seize the Ship as fair
Prize, and as if she had belong'd to _French_ Subjects, according to a
Commission he had for that Purpose; tho', one would think, after what he
had already done, that he need not have Recourse to a Quibble to give
his Actions a Colour.

In short, he took the Cargoe and sold it some Time after; yet still he
seem'd to have some Fears upon him least these Proceedings should have a
bad End; for, coming up with a _Dutch_ Ship some Time, when his Men
thought of nothing but attacking her, _Kid_ oppos'd it; upon which a
Mutiny arose, and the Majority being for taking the said Ship, and
arming themselves to Man the Boat to go and seize her, he told them,
such as did, never should come on Board him again; which put an End to
the Design, so that he kept Company with the said Ship some Time,
without offering her any Violence: However, this Dispute was the
Occasion of an Accident, upon which an Indictment was afterwards
grounded against _Kid_; for _Moor_, the Gunner, being one Day upon Deck,
and talking with _Kid_ about the said _Dutch_ Ship, some Words arose
betwixt them, and _Moor_ told _Kid_, that he had ruin'd them all; upon
which, _Kid_, calling him Dog, took up a Bucket and struck him with it,
which breaking his Skull, he died the next Day.

But _Kid_'s penitential Fit did not last long, for coasting along
_Malabar_, he met with a great Number of Boats, all which he plunder'd.
Upon the same Coast he also light upon a _Portuguese_ Ship, which he
kept Possession of a Week, and then having taken out of her some Chests
of _India_ Goods, thirty Jars of Butter, with some Wax, Iron, and a
hundred Bags of Rice, he let her go.

Much about the same Time he went to one of the _Malabar_ Islands for
Wood and Water, and his Cooper being ashore, was murder'd by the
Natives; upon which _Kid_ himself landed, and burnt and pillaged several
of their Houses, the People running away; but having taken one, he
caused him to be tied to a Tree, and commanded one of his Men to shoot
him; then putting to Sea again he took the greatest Prize, which fell
into his Hands, while he followed this Trade; this was a _Moorish_ Ship
of 400 Tons richly laden, named the _Queda_ Merchant, the Master whereof
was an _English_ Man, he was call'd _Wright_, for the _Indians_ often
make Use of _English_ or _Dutch_ Men to command their Ships, their own
Mariners not being so good Artists in Navigation.--_Kid_ chased her
under _French_ Colours, and having come up with her, he ordered her to
hoist out her Boat, and to send on Board of him, which being done, he
told _Wright_ he was his Prisoner; and informing himself concerning the
said Ship, he understood there were no _Europeans_ on Board, except two
_Dutch_, and one _Frenchman_, all the Rest being _Indians_ or
_Armenians_, and that the _Armenians_ were Part Owners of the Cargoe.
_Kid_ gave the _Armenians_ to understand, that if they would offer any
Thing that was worth his taking for their Ransome, he would hearken to
it: Upon which, they proposed to pay him twenty thousand Rupees, not
quite three thousand Pounds Sterling; but _Kid_ judged this would be
making a bad Bargain, wherefore he rejected it, and setting the Crew on
Shore, at different Places on the Coast, he soon sold as much of the
Cargoe as came to near ten thousand Pounds. With Part of it he also
trafficked, receiving in Exchange Provisions, or such other Goods as he
wanted; by Degrees he disposed of the whole Cargoe, and when the
Division was made, it came to about two hundred Pounds a Man, and having
reserved forty Shares to himself, his Dividend amounted to about eight
thousand Pounds Sterling.

The _Indians_ along the Coast came on Board and traffick'd with all
Freedom, and he punctually performed his Bargains, till about the Time
he was ready to sail; and then thinking he should have no further
Occasion for them, he made no Scruple of taking their Goods, and setting
them on Shore without any Payment in Money or Goods, which they little
expected; for as they had been used to deal with Pyrates, they always
found them Men of Honour in the Way of Trade: A People, Enemies to
Deceit, and that scorn'd to rob but in their own Way.

_Kid_ put some of his Men on Board the _Queda_ Merchant, and with this
Ship and his own sail'd for _Madagascar_; as soon as he was arrived and
had cast Anchor, there came on Board of him a Canoe, in which were
several _Englishmen_, who had formerly been well acquainted with _Kid_;
as soon as they saw him they saluted him, and told him, they were
informed he was come to take them, and hang them, which would be a
little unkind in such an old Acquaintance; _Kid_ soon dissipated their
Doubts, by swearing he had no such Design, and that he was now in every
Respect their Brother, and just as bad as they; and calling for a Cup of
Bomboo, drank their Captain's Health.

These Men belong'd to a Pyrate Ship, call'd the _Resolution_, formerly
the _Mocco_ Merchant, whereof one Captain _Culliford_ was Commander, and
which lay at an Anchor not far from them; _Kid_ went on Board with them,
promising them his Friendship and Assistance, and _Culliford_ in his
Turn came on Board of _Kid_; and _Kid_ to testify his Sincerity in
Iniquity, finding _Culliford_ in want of some Necessaries, made him a
Present of an Anchor and some Guns, to fit him out for the Sea again.

The _Adventure_ Galley was now so old and leaky, that they were forced
to keep two Pumps continually going, wherefore _Kid_ shifted all the
Guns and Tackle out of her into the _Queda_ Merchant, intending her for
his Man of War; and as he had divided the Money before, he now made a
Division of the Remainder of the Cargo: Soon after which, the greatest
Part of the Company left him, some going on Board Captain _Culliford_,
and others absconding in the Country, so that he had not above forty Men
left.

He put to Sea and happened to touch at _Amboyna_, one of the _Dutch_
Spice Islands, where he was told, that the News of his Actions had
reach'd _England_, and that he was there declared a Pyrate.

The Truth on't is, his Pyracies so alarmed our Merchants, that some
Motions were made in Parliament, to enquire into the Commission that was
given him, and the Persons who fitted him out: These Proceedings seem'd
to lean a little hard upon the Lord _Bellamont_, who thought himself so
much touch'd thereby, that he published a Justification of himself in a
Pamphlet after _Kid_'s Execution. In the mean Time, it was thought
adviseable, in order to stop the Course of these Pyracies, to publish a
Proclamation, offering the King's free Pardon to all such Pyrates as
should voluntarily surrender themselves, whatever Pyracies they had been
guilty of at any Time, before the last Day of _April_, 1699.--That is to
say, for all Pyracies committed Eastward of the _Cape_ of _Good Hope_,
to the Longitude and Meridian of _Socatora_, and _Cape Camorin_. In
which Proclamation, _Avery_ and _Kid_ were excepted by Name.

When _Kid_ left _Amboyna_ he knew nothing of this Proclamation, for
certainly had he had Notice of his being excepted in it, he would not
have been so infatuated, to run himself into the very Jaws of Danger;
but relying upon his Interest with the Lord _Bellamont_, and fancying,
that a _French_ Pass or two he found on Board some of the Ships he took,
would serve to countenance the Matter, and that Part of the Booty he got
would gain him new Friends.--I say, all these Things made him flatter
himself that all would be hushed, and that Justice would but wink at
him.--Wherefore he sail'd directly for _New-York_, where he was no
sooner arrived, but by the Lord _Bellamont_'s Orders, he was secured
with all his Papers and Effects. Many of his Fellow-Adventurers who had
forsook him at _Madagascar_, came over from thence Passengers, some to
_New England_ and some to _Jersey_; where hearing of the King's
Proclamation for pardoning of Pyrates, they surrendered themselves to
the Governor of those Places: At first they were admitted to Bail, but
soon after were laid in strict Confinement where they were kept for some
time, till an Opportunity happened of sending them with their Captain
over to _England_ to be tried.

Accordingly a Sessions of Admiralty being held at the _Old Baily_, in
_May_ 1701, Captain _Kid_, _Nicholas Churchill_, _James How_, _Robert
Lumley_, _William Jenkins_, _Gabriel Loff_, _Hugh Parrot_, _Richard
Barlicorn_, _Abel Owens_, and _Darby Mullins_, were arraign'd for Pyracy
and Robbery on the High Seas, and all found guilty, except three; these
were _Robert Lumley_, _William Jenkins_, and _Richard Barlicorne_, who
proving themselves to be Apprentices to some of the Officers of the
Ship, and producing their Indentures in Court, were acquitted.

The three above-mentioned, tho' they were proved to be concern'd in
taking and sharing the Ship and Goods mentioned in the Indictment, yet,
as the Gentlemen of the long Robe rightly distinguished, there was a
great Difference between their Circumstances and the rest; for there
must go an Intention of the Mind and a Freedom of the Will to the
committing an Act of Felony or Pyracy. A Pyrate is not to be understood
to be under Constraint, but a free Agent; for in this Case, the bare Act
will not make a Man guilty, unless the Will make it so.

Now a Servant, it is true, if he go voluntarily and have his Proportion,
he must be accounted a Pyrate, for then he acts upon his own Account,
and not by Compulsion; and these Persons, according to the Evidence,
received their Part, but whether they accounted to their Masters for
their Shares afterwards, is the Matter in Question, and what
distinguishes them as free Agents or Men, that did go under the
Compulsion of their Masters, which being left to the Consideration of
the Jury, they found them Not Guilty.

_Kid_ was tryed upon an Indictment of Murder also, _viz._ for killing
_Moor_ the Gunner, and found guilty of the same. _Nicholas Churchill_
and _James How_ pleaded the King's Pardon, as having surrendered
themselves within the Time limited in the Proclamation, and Colonel
_Bass_, Governor of _West Jersey_, to whom they surrendered, being in
Court, and called upon, proved the same; however, this Plea was
over-ruled by the Court, because there being four Commissioners named in
the Proclamation, _viz._ Captain _Thomas Warren_, _Israel Hayes_, _Peter
Delannoye_, and _Christopher Pollard_, Esqrs; who were appointed
Commissioners, and sent over on Purpose to receive the Submissions of
such Pyrates as should surrender, it was adjudged no other Person was
qualified to receive their Surrender, and that they could not be
intitled to the Benefit of the said Proclamation, because they had not
in all Circumstances complied with the Conditions of it.

_Darby Mullins_ urg'd in his Defence, that he serv'd under the King's
Commission, and therefore could not disobey his Commander without
incurring great Punishments; that whenever a Ship or Ships went out upon
any Expedition under the King's Commissioners, the Men were never
allowed to call their Officers to an Account, why they did this, or, why
they did that, because such a Liberty would destroy all Discipline; that
if any Thing was done which was unlawful, the Officers were to answer
it, for the Men did no more than their Duty in obeying Orders. He was
told by the Court, that acting under the Commission justified in what
was lawful, but not in what was unlawful; he answered, he stood in Need
of nothing to justify him in what was lawful, but that the Case of
Seamen must be very hard, if they must be brought into such Danger for
obeying the Commands of their Officers, and punished for not obeying
them; and if they were allowed to dispute the Orders, there could be no
such Thing as Command kept up at Sea.

This seem'd to be the best Defence the Thing could bear; but his taking
a Share of the Plunder, the Seamens mutinying on Board several Times,
and taking upon them to controul the Captain, shewed there was no
Obedience paid to the Commission; and that they acted in all Things
according to the Custom of Pyrates and Free-booters, which weighing with
the Jury, they brought him in guilty with the rest.

As to Capt. _Kid_'s Defence, he insisted much upon his own Innocence,
and the Villany of his Men; he said, he went out in a laudable
Employment, and had no Occasion, being then in good Circumstances, to go
a Pyrating; that the Men often mutinied against him, and did as they
pleas'd; that he was threatened to be shot in his Cabin, and that Ninety
five left him at one Time, and set Fire to his Boat, so that he was
disabled from bringing his Ship home, or the Prizes he took, to have
them regularly condemn'd, which he said were taken by Virtue of a
Commission under the Broad Seal, they having _French_ Passes.--The
Captain called one Col. _Hewson_ to his Reputation, who gave him an
extraordinary Character, and declared to the Court, that he had served
under his Command, and been in two Engagements with him against the
_French_, in which he fought as well as any Man he ever saw; that there
were only _Kid_'s Ship and his own against Monsieur _du Cass_, who
commanded a Squadron of six Sail, and they got the better of him.--But
this being several Years before the Facts mentioned in the Indictment
were committed, prov'd of no manner of Service to the Prisoner on his
Tryal.

As to the Friendship shewn to _Culliford_, a notorious Pyrate, _Kid_
deny'd, and said, he intended to have taken him, but his Men being a
Parcel of Rogues and Villains refused to stand by him, and several of
them ran away from his Ship to the said Pyrate.--But the Evidence being
full and particular against him, he was found guilty as before
mentioned.

When _Kid_ was asked what he had to say why Sentence should not pass
against him, he answered, That _he had nothing to say, but that he had
been sworn against by perjured wicked People_. And when Sentence was
pronounced, he said, _My Lord, it is a very hard Sentence. For my Part,
I am the innocentest Person of them all, only I have been sworn against
by perjured Persons._

Wherefore about a Week after, Capt. _Kid_, _Nicholas Churchill_, _James
How_, _Gabriel Loff_, _Hugh Parrot_, _Abel Owen_, and _Darby Mullins_,
were executed at _Execution Dock_, and afterwards hung up in Chains, at
some Distance from each other, down the River, where their Bodies hung
exposed for many Years.


                                   OF
                             Captain _TEW_,
                             And his CREW.

Before I enter on the Adventures of this Pyrate, I must take Notice to
the Reader of the Reasons which made me not continue the Life of
_Misson_.

In reading the Notes, which I have by me, relating to Captain _Tew_, I
found him join'd with _Misson_; and that I must either be guilty of
Repetition, or give an Account of _Tew_ in _Misson_'s Life, which is
contrary to the Method I propos'd, that of giving a distinct Relation of
every Pyrate who has made any Figure: And surely _Tew_, in Point of
Gallantry, was inferior to none, and may justly claim a particular
Account of his Actions.

However, before I enter on the Life of this Pyrate, I shall continue
that of _Misson_ to the Time that these two Commanders met.

                   *       *       *       *       *

The Blacks seeing them so much upon their Guard, brought out boiled Rice
and Fowls, and after they had satisfied their Hunger, the Chief made
Signs that they were the same who had carried a Negroe to their Ships,
and sent for the Ax and Piece of Baze they had given him: While this
pass'd, the very Negroe came from hunting, who seem'd overjoy'd to see
them. The Chief made Signs that they might return, and ten Negroes
coming to them laden with Fowls and Kids; he gave them to understand,
they should accompany them to their Ships with these Presents.

They parted very amicably, and in hopes of settling a good
Correspondence with these Natives; all the Houses were neatly framed and
jointed, not built from any Foundation, but so made, that half a dozen
Men could lift and transport them from Place to Place; and sometimes a
whole Village shall be in Motion, which would be an odd Sight in
_Europe_, and surprizing to see Houses moving. The Hunters returning to
their Ships, with these Presents and Negroes, were joyfully received;
and the Negroes not only caressed, but laden with Baze, Iron Kettles,
and Rum, besides the Present of a Cutlash for the Chief.

While the Negroes stay'd, which was the Space of three Days, they
examined and admired the Forts and growing Town, in which all Hands were
busied, and not even the Prisoners excused.

As Monsieur _Misson_ apprehended no Danger from the Land, his Fort (tho'
of Wood) being, he thought, a sufficient Defence to his infant Colony;
he took a hundred and sixty Hands, and went a second Time on the Coast
of _Zanguebor_, and off _Quiloa_ he gave Chase to a large Ship, which
lay by for him: She prov'd an over-match for the _Victoire_, which
engag'd her, with great Loss of Men, near eight Glasses; but finding he
was more likely to be took, than to make a Prize, by the Advice of his
Officers and Men, endeavour'd to leave the _Portuguese_, which was a 50
Gun Ship, and had 300 Men on Board; but he found this Attempt vain, for
the _Portuguese_ went as well as the _Victoire_, and the Commander was a
resolute and brave Man, who, seeing him endeavour to shake him off,
clapp'd him on Board, but lost most of the Men he enter'd. _Misson_'s
Crew not used to be attack'd, and expecting no Quarter, fought so
desperately, that they not thoroly clear'd their Decks, but some of them
follow'd the _Portuguese_, who leap'd into their own Ship; which
_Misson_ seeing, hop'd to make an Advantage of their Despair, and crying
out, _Elle est a nous, a l'abordage_. She's our own, board, board her,
so many of his Men followed the few, that hardly were there enough left
to work the Ship; _Misson_ observing this Resolution in his Men,
grappled the _Portuguese_ Ship, and leap'd himself on Board, crying out,
_la Mort, ou la Victoire_, Death or Victory. The _Portuguese_, who
thought themselves in a manner Conquerors, seeing the Enemy not only
drive off those who enter'd them, but board with that Resolution, began
to quit the Decks in Spight of their Officers: The Captain and _Misson_
met, as he was endeavouring to hinder the Flight of his Men; they
engaged with equal Bravery with their Cutlashes; but _Misson_ striking
him on the Neck, he fell down the main Hatch, which put an End to the
Fight, for the _Portuguese_ seeing their Captain fall, threw down their
Arms, and call'd for Quarters, which was granted; and all the Prisoners
without Distinction being order'd between Decks, and the Powder-Room
secured, he put 35 Men on Board the Prize, and made the best of his Way
for _Libertatia_. This was the dearest Prize he ever made, for he lost
fifty six Men: She was vastly rich in Gold, having near 200,000 l.
Sterling on Board, being her own and the Cargo of her Companion, which
was lost upon the Coast, of whose Crew she had saved 100 Men out of 120,
the rest being lost, by endeavouring to swim ashore; whereas had their
Fear suffer'd them to have staid, there had not been a Soul lost, the
Tide of Ebb leaving their Ship dry: This was the Reason that the Prize
was so well mann'd, and proved so considerable.

Being within Sight of _Madagascar_, they spied a Sloop which stood for
them, and when in Gun-Shot, threw out black Colours, and fired a Gun to
Windward; _Misson_ brought to, fired another to Leeward, and hoisted out
his Boat, which the Sloop perceiving, lay by for. _Misson_'s Lieutenant
went on Board, and was received very civilly by Captain _Tew_, who was
the Commander, to whom the Lieutenant gave a short Account of their
Adventures and new Settlement, inviting him very kindly on Board Captain
_Misson_. _Tew_ told him, he could not consent to go with him till he
had the Opinion of his Men; in the mean while _Misson_, coming
along-side, hal'd the Sloop, and invited the Captain on Board, desiring
his Lieutenant would stay as an Hostage, if they were in the least
jealous of him; which they had no Reason to be, since he was of Force so
much superior, that he need not employ Stratagem. This determined the
Company on Board the Sloop, who advised their Captain to go with the
Lieutenant, whom they would not suffer to stay behind, to shew the
greater Confidence in their new Friends.

My Reader may be surprized that a single Sloop should venture to give
Chase to two Ships of such Countenance as were the _Victoire_ and her
Prize: But this Wonder will cease, when he is acquainted with the
Sequel.

Captain _Tew_ after being handsomely regal'd on Board the _Victoire_,
and thoroughly satisfied, returned on Board his Sloop, gave an Account
of what he had learned, and his Men consenting, he gave Orders to steer
the same Course with _Misson_, whose Settlement it was agreed to visit.

I shall here leave them to give an Account of Captain _Tew_.

Mr. _Richier_, Governor of _Bermudas_, fitted out two Sloops on the
Privateer Account, commanded by Captain _George Drew_, and Captain
_Thomas Tew_, with Instructions to make the best of their Way to the
River _Gambia_ in _Africa_, and there, with the Advice and Assistance of
the Agent for the Royal _African_ Company, to attempt the taking the
_French_ Factory of _Goorie_ on that Coast.

The above Commanders having their Commissions and Instructions from the
Governor, took their Departure from _Bermudas_, and kept Company some
Time; but _Drew_ springing his Mast, and a violent Storm coming upon
them, they lost each other.

_Tew_ being separated from his Consort, thought of providing for his
future case, by making one bold Push; and accordingly, calling all Hands
on Deck, he spoke to them to this Purpose.

'That they were not ignorant of the Design with which the Governor
fitted them out; the taking and destroying the _French_ Factory; that
he, indeed, readily agreed to take a Commission to this end, tho'
contrary to his Judgment, because it was being employ'd; but that he
thought it a very injudicious Expedition, which did they succeed in,
would be of no Use to the Publick, and only advantage a private Company
of Men, from whom they could expect no Reward of their Bravery; that he
could see nothing but Danger in the Undertaking, without the least
Prospect of a Booty; that he could not suppose any Man fond of fighting,
for fighting-sake; and few ventured their Lives, but with some View
either of particular Interest or publick Good; but here was not the
least Appearance of either. Wherefore, he was of Opinion, that they
should turn their Thoughts on what might better their Circumstances; and
if they were so inclined, he would undertake to shape a Course which
should lead them to Ease and Plenty, in which they might pass the rest
of their Days. That one bold Push would do their Business, and they
might return home, not only without Danger, but even with Reputation.'
The Crew finding he expected their Resolution, cry'd out, one and all,
_A gold Chain, or a wooden Leg_, we'll stand by you.

Hearing this, he desired they would chuse a Quarter Master, who might
consult with him for the Common Good; which was accordingly done.

I must acquaint the Reader, that on Board the _West-India_ Privateers
and Free-booters, the Quarter Master's Opinion is like the Mufti's among
the _Turk_'s; the Captain can undertake nothing which the Quarter Master
does not approve. We may say, the Quarter Master is an humble Imitation
of the _Roman_ Tribune of the People; he speaks for, and looks after the
Interest of the Crew.

_Tew_ now, instead of his proceeding on his Voyage to _Gambia_, shaped
his Course for the Cape of _Good Hope_, which doubling, he steered for
the Streights of _Babel Mandel_, entring into the _Red Sea_, where they
came up with a tall Ship bound from the _Indies_ to _Arabia_; she was
richly laden, and as she was to clear the Coasts of Rovers, five more,
extreamly rich (one especially in Gold) being to follow her, she had 300
Soldiers on Board, beside her Seamen.

_Tew_, on making this Ship, told his Men she carried their Fortunes,
which they would find no Difficulty to take Possession of; for though he
was satisfied she was full of Men, and was mounted with a great Number
of Guns, they wanted the two Things necessary, Skill and Courage; and,
indeed, so it proved, for he boarded and carried her without Loss, every
one taking more Care to run from the Danger, than to exert himself in
the Defence of his Goods.

In rummaging this Prize, the Pyrates threw over a great many rich Bales,
to search for Gold, Silver, and Jewels; and, having taken what they
thought proper, together with the Powder, part of which (as being more
than they could handsomely stow) they threw into the Sea; they left her,
sharing 3000 l. Sterling a Man.

Encouraged by this Success, Captain _Tew_ proprosed the going in quest
of the other five Ships, of which he had Intelligence from the Prize;
but the Quarter-Master opposing him, he was obliged to drop the Design,
and steer for _Madagascar_.

Here the Quarter Master finding this Island productive of all the
Necessaries of Life; that the Air was wholesome, the Soil fruitful, and
the Sea abounding with Fish, proposed settling; but only three and
twenty of the Crew came into the Proposal: The rest staid with Captain
_Tew_, who having given the new Settlers their Share of Plunder,
designed to return to _America_, as they afterwards did; but spying the
_Victoire_ and her Prize, he thought he might, by their Means, return
somewhat richer, and resolved to speak with them, as I have already
said.

_Tew_ and his Company having taken the above Resolution of visiting
Mons. _Misson_'s Colony, arrived with him, and was not a little
surprized to see his Fortifications.

When they came under the first Fort, they saluted it with nine Guns, and
they were answered with an equal Number; all the Prisoners, at their
coming to an Anchor, were suffer'd to come up, a Privilege they had
never before granted them, on account of the few Hands left them, except
two or three at a time.

The Joy those ashore expressed at the Sight of so considerable a Prize
as they judged her at first Sight, was vastly allay'd, when they heard
how dear a Purchase she had prov'd to them; however, the Reinforcement
of the Sloop made some amends; Captain _Tew_ was received by
_Caraccioli_ and the rest, with great Civility and Respect, who did not
a little admire his Courage, both in attacking the Prize he made, and
afterwards in giving Chase to _Misson_; he was called to the Council of
Officers, which was immediately held, to consider what Methods should be
taken with the Prisoners, who were, by 190 brought in by this new Prize,
near as numerous as those of his own Party, though _Tew_ join them with
70 Men; it was therefore resolved to keep them separate from the
_Portuguese_ and _English_, who were before taken, to make them believe
they were in Amity with a Prince of the Natives, who was very powerful,
and to propose to them, at their Choice, the assisting the new Colony in
their Works, or the being sent Prisoners up the Country, if they
rejected the entering with them. Seventy three took on, and the rest
desired they might be any way employ'd, rather than be sent up the
Country; 117 then were set to Work upon a Dock, which was laid out about
half a Mile above the Mouth of the Harbour, and the other Prisoners were
forbid to pass such Bounds as were prescribed them on Pain of Death;
lest they, knowing their own Strength, should revolt; for I must
acquaint the Reader, that on the Arrival of the _Victoire_, both their
Loss and the Number of _Portuguese_ they brought in, was known to none
but themselves, and the Number of those who came over, magnified;
besides, the _Johanna_ Men were all arm'd and disciplin'd, and the
_Bijoux_ laid a Guardship, where the last Prisoners were set to Work;
but while they provided for their Security, both within and without,
they did not neglect providing also for their Support, for they dug and
sow'd a large Plat of Ground with _Indian_ and _European_ Corn, and
other Seeds which they had found on Board their Prizes. In the mean
while _Caraccioli_, who had the Art of Perswasion, wrought on many of
the _Portuguese_, who saw no Hopes of returning home, to join them.
_Misson_, who could not be easy in an inactive Life, would have taken
another Cruize; but fearing the Revolt of the Prisoners, durst not
weaken his Colony by the Hands he must necessarily take with him:
Wherefore, he propos'd giving the last Prize to, and sending away the
Prisoners. _Carracioli_ and Captain _Tew_ were against it, saying, that
it would discover their Retreat, and cause their being attacked by the
_Europeans_, who had Settlements along the Continent, before they were
able to defend themselves. _Misson_ reply'd, he could not bear to be
always diffident of those about him; that it was better die once, than
live in continual Apprehensions of Death. That the Time was come for the
sending away the _Johanna_ Men, and that they could not go without a
Ship, neither durst he trust a Ship out, not well mann'd, nor man her
while so many Prisoners were with him. Wherefore there was a Necessity
of sending them off, or of putting them all to the Sword. A Barbarity by
which he would not purchase his Security. A Council was called, and what
Captain _Misson_ had proposed, agreed to. The Prisoners were then
summon'd and he told them, in few Words, that he knew the Consequence of
giving them Liberty; that he expected to be attacked as soon as the
Place of his Retreat was known, and had it in his Hands, by putting them
to Death to avoid the doubtful Fate of War; but his Humanity would not
suffer him to entertain a Thought so cruel, and his Alliances with the
Natives, he hoped, would enable him to repel his Assailants; but he
required an Oath of every one, that he should not serve against him: He
then enquired into the Circumstances of every particular Man, and what
they had lost, all which he return'd, telling the Company it should be
reckoned as Part of his Share, and the Prisoners, that he did not make
War with the Oppressed, but the Oppressors. The Prisoners were charm'd
with this Mark of Generosity and Humanity, and wished he might never
meet a Treatment unworthy of that he gave them. The Ship being
victualled for a Voyage to the Coast of _Zanguebar_, all her Guns and
Ammunitions taken out, with the spare Sails, and spare Rigging, all were
ordered to be gone, and 137 departed, highly applauding the Behaviour of
their Enemies. All this while they had heard nothing from the Natives,
nor had the hunting Parties met with any of them, which made _Misson_
suspect they were afraid of his being their Neighbour, and had shifted
their Quarters; but as the _Johanna_ Men were upon going away, there
came about 50 Negroes to them, driving about 100 Head of black Cattle,
20 Negroe Men bound, and 25 Women, for which Cattle and Prisoners they
barter'd Rum, Hatchets, Baze and Beads; some Hogsheads of which last
Commodity they had taken on the Coast of _Angola_. Here the Negroes
belonging to _Misson_ were provided with Wives: The Natives were
caress'd, and to the Slaves Signs made that their Liberty was given
them, they were immediately cloathed and put under the Care of as many
Whites, who, by all possible Demonstrations, endeavoured to make them
understand that they were Enemies to Slavery. The Natives staid ten
Days, which retarded the Departure of the _Johanna_ Men; but, upon their
retiring, the _Bijoux_ sailed with 100 of them on Board, under the
command of _Caraccioli_'s Lieutenant, who excused the keeping them a
Month longer than was promised, and not bringing them at once, having no
more than two Ships. The _Portuguese_ Ship, which was unrigg'd, being
made a Hulk, the ten Men of _Misson_'s Company who had settled at
_Johanna_, being desirous to return, were brought to _Libertatia_ with
their Wives (of which they had two and three a piece) and their
Children, the _Bijoux_, at two more Voyages, carried over the rest of
the _Johannians_.

_Misson_ hove down the _Bijoux_, and resolving on a Cruise on the Coast
of _Guiney_, to strengthen his Colony by the Capture of some slaving
Ship, he gave the Command of her to Captain _Tew_, and he and
_Caraccioli_ press'd the Work of the Dock; he gave him also 200 Hands,
of which 40 were _Portuguese_, 37 Negroes, 17 of them expert Sailors, 30
_English_, and the rest _French_. _Tew_ met with nothing in his Way till
he came to the Northward of the Cape of _Good Hope_, when he fell in
with a _Dutch East-India_ Galley of 18 Guns, which he took after a small
Resistance, and with the Loss of one Man only; on the Coast of _Angola_
he took an _English_ Man with 240 Slaves, Men, Women, and Boys. The
Negroes, who had before been taken on this Coast, found among these a
great many of their Acquaintance, and several of their Relations, to
whom they reported their happy and unexpected change of Fortune, the
great Captain (for so they now called _Misson_) humanly having knocked
off their Chains, and of Slaves made them free Men, and Sharers in his
Fortunes. That the same good Fortune had attended them in their falling
into his Hands, for he abhorr'd even the Name of Slavery. _Tew_
following the Orders, and acquainted with the Policy of _Misson_,
order'd their Fetters and Handcuffs to be taken off, upon his Negroe
Sailors, assuring him they would not revolt, and were sensible of their
Happiness in falling into his Hands. Content with these Prizes, he made
the best of his Way home to _Libertatia_, where he arrived without any
sinister Accident; but I forgot to tell my Reader, that he set his
_Dutch_ Prisoners (nine excepted, who took on with him) ashore, about 30
Miles to the Northward of the Cape, in _Soldinia_ Bay, where had been
buried, by Captain _Misson_, the _English_ Commander; he found a great
Quantity of _English_ Crowns on Board his _Dutch_ Prize, which were
carried into the common Treasury, Money being of no Use where every
Thing was in common, and no Hedge bounded any particular Man's Property.
The Slaves he had released in this last Cruize were employ'd in the
perfecting the Dock, and treated on the Foot of free People. They were
not ignorant of the Change of their Condition, and were therefore
extreamly diligent and faithful. A White Man, or one of the old standing
Negroes, wrought with every four, and made them understand the _French_
Words (by often Repetition, and the Help of their Country Mens
interpreting) used in their Works. _Misson_ ordered a couple of Sloops
to be built in a Creek, of 80 Tun each, which he mounted with 8 Guns a
piece, out of the _Dutch_ Prize. These were perfected in a little Time,
and proved not only shapely Vessels, but excellent Sailors. The Officers
of these Sloops were chosen by ballotting, and as their first Design was
only to discover and lay down a Chart of the Coast, Sands, Shoals, and
Depths of Water round the Island of _Madagascar_; The School Master
being sent for that Reason with the Command of one, _Tew_ desired, and
had the other. They were mann'd, each Sloop with 50 Whites and 50 black
Men. Which Voyage round the Island was of vast Advantage in giving the
new released _Angola_ Negroes a Notion of the working a Vessel; and they
were very industrious both in endeavouring to learn the _French_
Language, and to be useful. These Sloops, the one of which was called
the _Childhood_, and the other the _Liberty_, were near four Months on
this Expedition; in the mean while a few of the Natives had come often
to the Settlement, and they began to speak a little broken _French_,
mix'd with the other _European_ Languages, which they heard among
_Misson_'s People, and six of the native Families fixed among them,
which was of vast Use to the Planters of this new Colony; for they made
a very advantageous Report to their Country Men of the Regularity and
Harmony they observed in them. The Sloops being return'd, and an exact
Chart taken of the Coast, _Carraccioli_ had a mind for a Cruize; he
proposed the visiting all the neighbouring Islands, accordingly he went
out to _Mascarenas_, and the other Islands near it, taking one half of
his Crew of Negroes, and return'd with a _Dutch_ Prize, which he took
off the abovementioned Island, where they were about fixing a Colony.
This Prize, as it had on Board all Sorts of _European_ Goods, and
Necessaries for settling, was more valuable than if it had been vastly
richer. The Negroes growing useful Hands, _Misson_ resolved on a Cruize
to the Northward, encouraged by _Tew_'s Success; and, with all the
Blacks, which he divided between the two Ships, one of which Captain
_Tew_ commanded, set out with 500 Men: Off the Coast of _Arabia Foelix_,
they fell in with a Ship belonging to the _Great Mogul_, bound for
_Zidon_, with Pilgrims to _Mecca_, who, with _Moor_ Mariners, made up
the Number of 1600 Souls. This Ship carried 110 Guns, but made a very
poor Defence, being encumber'd with the Goods and Number of Passengers
they carried. The two Adventurers did not think it their Business to
cannonade, they therefore boarded as soon as they came up with her, and
the _Moors_ no sooner saw them enter'd, but they discharged one Volley
of small Arms at Random, we may suppose, because no Execution was done,
and fled the Decks. Being Masters of this Ship, which did not cost them
a single Man, they consulted what they should do with her, and the
Prisoners, and it was resolved to set them ashore between _Ain_ and
_Aden_; but as they wanted Women, to keep all the unmarried, and to
navigate the Ship to _Libertatia_; as the Guns might be of Use to them;
and, by letting her go, or sinking, they might lose, perhaps, a
considerable Booty, which the _Moors_, might have hid in her Cielings or
Ballast.

This Resolution was put in Execution, and they brought off 100 Girls,
from 12 to 18 Years old, who designed to make the Pilgrimage with their
Parents. The Lamentations this Separation caused among the Prisoners,
had such Effect on _Misson_, that he was for letting them go, but every
one of his Men were against him. They now made the best of their Way for
_Madagascar_, putting 200 Hands on board the Prize, which proved a very
heavy Sailer, and retarded them very much. Off the Cape _Guarde Fin_
they were overtaken with a cruel Storm, which was very near wrecking
them on the Island called _Irmanos_; but the Wind coming about due
North, they had the good Luck to escape this Danger. Though the Fury of
the Wind abated, yet it blew so hard for 12 Days together, that they
could only carry their Courses reef'd. They spy'd a Sail in their
Passage, but the Weather would not permit their endeavouring to speak
with her. In a Word, they return'd to _Libertatia_ with their Prize,
without any other Accident, but the Captors could make no Estimate of
her Value, she having on Board a vast Quantity of Diamonds, besides rich
Silks, raw Silks, Spices, Carpets, and wrought and bar Gold. The Prize
was taken to pieces, as she was of no Use; her Cordage and knee Timber
preserv'd, with all the Bolts, Eyes, Chains, and other Iron Work, and
her Guns planted on two Points of the Harbour, where they raised
Batteries, so that they were now so strongly fortified they apprehended
no Danger from any Number of Shipping which could be brought into those
Seas to attack them. They had, by this Time, clear'd, sown, and enclosed
a good Parcel of Ground, and taken in a Quantity of Pasturage, where
they had above 300 Head of black Cattle, bought of the Natives. The Dock
was now finish'd, and the _Victoire_ growing old and unfit for a long
Voyage, and the last Storm having shook and loosened her very much, she
was pull'd to pieces and rebuilt, keeping the same Name. She was rigg'd,
victuall'd, and fit to go to Sea, and was to sail to the Coast of
_Guinea_ for more Negroes, when one of the Sloops came in, which had
been sent out rather to exercise the Negroes, than with any View of
making a Prize, and brought Word five tall Ships chac'd her into the
Bay, and stood for their Harbour; that she judg'd them to be
_Portuguese_ by their Built, and 50 Gun Ships, full of Men. This prov'd
the real Truth. The Alarm was given, the Forts and Batteries mann'd, and
every Man stood to his Arms. _Misson_ took upon him the Command of 100
Negroes, who were well disciplin'd, (for every Morning they had been
used to perform their Exercise, which was taught them by a _French_
Serjeant, one of their Company, who belong'd to the _Victoire_) to be
ready where his Assistance should be requir'd. _Tew_ commanded all the
_English_. They had hardly order'd their Affairs when these Ships hove
in Sight, and stood directly for the Harbour with _Portuguese_ Colours.
They were warmly received by the two Forts, which did not stop them,
though it brought one of them on the Careen; they enter'd the Harbour,
and thought they had done their Business, but were saluted so warmly
from the Forts and Batteries, Sloops and Ships, that two of them sunk
downright, and a great many Men were drowned, though some got on Board
the other Ships. The _Portuguese_, who did not imagine they had been so
well fortified, and thought in passing the two Forts they should,
without Difficulty, land their Men, and easily root out this Nest of
Pyrates, found now their Mistake, for they durst not venture to hoist
out a Boat. They had wisely, however, contriv'd to enter just before the
Turn of the Tide. Finding the Attempt vain, and that they lost a great
many Men, they clapp'd upon a Wind, and with the Help of the Tide of
Ebb, made more Haste out than they did to get in, leaving two of their
Ships sunk in the Harbour; but they did not get off so cheaply, for no
sooner were they clear of the Forts, but _Misson_ manning, with the
utmost Expedition, both the Ships and the Sloops, he gave them Chase,
and engag'd them at the Mouth of the Bay. The _Portuguese_ defended
themselves with a great deal of Gallantry, and one of them put off the
_Libertatians_ twice, who boarded them from the two Sloops; two of them,
finding themselves hard press'd, made a running Fight, and got off, and
left the third to shift as well as he could. The _Bijoux_ and _Victoire_
finding the _Portuguese_ endeavour'd to clear themselves, and knowing
there was little to be got by the Captures, gave over the Chase, and
fell upon the third, who defended himself till his Decks swam with
Blood, and the greater Number of his Men killed; but finding all
Resistance vain, and that he was left to an unequal Fight by his
Companions, he called for Quarter, and good Quarter was given, both to
himself and Men. This Prize yielded them a great Quantity of Powder and
Shot, and, indeed, they expected nothing of Value out of her. None of
the Prisoners were stripp'd, and the Officers, _Misson_, _Caraccioli_
and _Tew_, invited to their Tables, treating them very civilly, and
extolling the Courage they had shewn in their Defence. Unhappily two
Prisoners were found on Board, who had been released, and had sworn
never to serve against them; these were clapp'd in Irons, and publickly
tried for their Perjury. The _Portuguese_ Officers being present, the
Witnesses proved them the very discharged Men, and they were condemned
to be hanged at the Point of each Fort; which Execution was performed
the next Morning after their Condemnation, with the Assistance of the
_Portuguese_ Chaplain, who attended, confess'd and absolv'd them. This
was the Engagement with the Pyrates, which made so much Noise in the
_Lisbon_ Gazette, and these the Men whom the _English_ ignorantly took
for _Avery_; who, we had a Notion here in _London_, had 32 Sail of Men
of War, and had taken upon him the State and Title of King, a Mistake we
have already spoken to in the first Volume.

This Execution seeming to impugn the Maxims of the Chiefs, _Caraccioli_
made an Harangue, in which he told them, that there was no Rule could be
laid down which did not allow Exceptions: That they were all sensible
how tender the Commadore, Monsieur _Misson_, was in shedding of Blood;
and that it was a Tenet of his Faith, that none had Power over the Life
of another, but God alone, who gave it; but notwithstanding,
Self-Preservation sometimes made it absolutely necessary to take away
the Life of another, especially an avow'd and an obliged Enemy, even in
cool Blood. As to the Blood shed in a lawful War, in Defence of that
Liberty they had generously asserted, it was needless to say any Thing,
but thought it proper to lay before them Reasons for the Execution of
the Criminals, and the Heinousness of their Crimes. They had not only
received their Lives from the Bounty of the _Libertatians_, but their
Liberty, and had every Thing restored them which they laid claim to,
consequently their Ingratitude rose in Proportion to the generous
Treatment they had met with. That, indeed, both he and Captain _Misson_
would have passed by the Perjury and Ingratitude they had been guilty
of, with a corporal Punishment, which had not extended to the
Deprivation of Life, but their gallant Friend and Companion the
_English_ Commander, Captain _Tew_, used such cogent Reasons for an
exemplary Punishment, to deter others from the like Crimes, that they
must have been Enemies to their own Preservation in not following his
Advice. That the Lives of their whole Body ought to be preferr'd to
those of declared and perjured Enemies, who would not cease to endeavour
their Ruin; and, as they were well acquainted with their Settlement,
might be fatal Instruments of it, if they were again restored to that
Liberty which they had already abused. That he was obliged to do Captain
_Tew_ the Justice, to acknowledge he was inclined to the Side of Mercy,
till he was thoroughly informed of the Blackness of their Ingratitude,
and then he thought it would be Cruelty to themselves to let those
Miscreants experience a second Time their Clemency; thus an absolute
Necessity had obliged them to act contrary to their declar'd Principles;
tho', to state the Case rightly, these Men, not the _Libertatians_, were
the Authors of their own Deaths: Here the Assembly crying out, _their
Blood is on their own Heads, they sought their Deaths, and hanging was
too good for them_; _Caraccioli_ gave over, and every one returned
satisfied to his private or the publick Affairs.

Some Differences arising between _Misson_'s and _Tew_'s Men, on a
national Quarrel, which the latter began; Captain _Tew_ proposed their
deciding the Quarrel by the Sword, but _Caraccioli_ was entirely against
it, alledging, that such a Decision must necessarily be a Damage to the
Publick, since the brave Men who fell, would be a weakening of their
Colony; he therefore desired Captain _Tew_ to interpose the Authority he
had over his Crew, as he and _Misson_ would endeavour to bring their Men
to an amicable Agreement; and for the future, as this Accident proved
the Necessity, wholesome Laws should be made, and a Form of Government
entered upon, both Parties were call'd, and _Caraccioli_ shew'd them the
Necessity of their living in Unity among themselves, who had the whole
World for Enemies; and as he had a perswasive and insinuating Way of
Argument, with the Assistance of Captain _Tew_, this Affair was ended to
the Satisfaction of both Parties.

The next Day the whole Colony was assembled, and the three Commanders
propos'd a Form of Government, being taken up, as necessary to their
Conservation; for where there were no coercive Laws, the weakest would
always be the Sufferers, and every Thing must tend to Confusion: That
Mens Passions blinding them to Justice, and making them ever partial to
themselves, they ought to submit the Differences which might arise to
calm and disinterested Persons, who could examine with Temper, and
determine according to Reason and Equity: That they look'd upon a
Democratical Form, where the People were themselves the Makers and
Judges of their own Laws, the most agreeable; and therefore, desired
they would divide themselves into Companies of ten Men, and every such
Company chuse one to assist in the settling a Form of Government, and in
making wholesome Laws for the Good of the whole: That the Treasure and
Cattle they were Masters of should be equally divided, and such Lands as
any particular Man would enclose, should, for the future, be deem'd his
Property, which no other should lay any Claim to, if not alienated by a
Sale.

The Proposal was received with Applause, and they decimated themselves
that very Day, but put off the meeting of the States till a House was
built, which they set about very chearfully, and finish'd in about a
Fortnight; it being of framed Timber, and they having among them a great
many who understood the handling an Ax.

When this Body of Politicians met, _Caraccioli_ open'd the Sessions with
a handsome Speech, shewing the Advantage flowing from Order; and then
spoke to the Necessity of lodging a supream Power in the Hands of one,
who should have that of rewarding brave and vertuous Actions, and of
punishing the vicious, according to the Laws which the State should
make; by which, he was to be guided. That such a Power however should
not be for Life, nor hereditary, but determinate at the end of three
Years, when a new Choice should be made by the State, or the Old
confirm'd for three Years longer; by which means, the ablest Men would
always be at the Head of Affairs, and their Power being of short
Duration, none would dare to abuse it: That such a Chief should have the
Title of Lord Conservator, and all the Ensigns of Royalty to attend him.

This was approv'd _Nemine contradicente_, and _Misson_ was chose
Conservator, with Power to create great Officers, _&c._ and with the
Title of Supream Excellence.

Then a Law was made for the meeting of the State once every Year at
least, but oftner, if the Conservator and his Council thought it
necessary for the common Good to convene them; and that nothing of
Moment should be undertaken without the Approbation of the State.

In a Word, their first Sessions lasted ten Days; and a great many
wholesome Laws were enacted, register'd in the State-Book, printed and
dispers'd (for they had some Printers and Letter Founders among them)
and then the Conservator dissolved them.

Captain _Tew_, the Conservator, honoured with the Title of Admiral, and
_Caraccioli_ made Secretary of State; he chose a Council of the ablest
among them, without Distinction of Nation or Colour; and the different
Languages began to be incorporated, and one made out of the many: An
equal Division was made of their Treasure and Cattle, and every one
began either to inclose Land for himself or his Neighbour, who would
hire his Assistance.

Admiral _Tew_ propos'd the building an Arsenal, and augmenting their
Naval Force; the first was agreed to be propos'd to the State at the
next Convention, but the latter was thought unnecessary, till the Number
of Inhabitants was augmented; for should they all be employed in the Sea
Service, the Husbandry would be neglected, which would be of fatal
Consequence to the growing Colony.

The Admiral then proposed the fetching in those _Englishmen_ who had
followed the Quarter Master; but the Council rejected this, alledging,
that as they deserted their Captain, it was a Mark of a mutinous Temper,
and they might infect others with a Spirit of Disorder; that however,
they might have Notice given them of the Settlement, and if they made it
their earnest Intreaty to be admitted, and would desert the
Quarter-Master, it should be granted as a particular Favour done them,
at the instance of the Admiral, and upon his engaging his Parole of
Honour for their quiet Behaviour.

The Admiral then desired he might take a Cruize; that he hop'd to meet
with some _East-India_ Ships, and bring in some Voluntiers, for the
Number of Subjects being the Riches of a Nation, he thought the Colony
stood more in need of Men, than of any Thing else; that he would lie in
the Way of the Cape, and did not question doing good Service; and as he
went to the Northward, would call upon his own Men.

The _Victoire_ was according to the Admiral's Desire fitted out, and in
few Days he sail'd with 300 Men on board; he came to an Anchor at the
Settlement his Men had made, and hoisted an _English_ Ensign in his Fore
Shrouds, and fir'd a Gun; but after he had waited some Time, perceiving
no Signal from the Shore, he landed and sent back his Boat; soon after
the Boat was returned towards the Ship, two of his Men came up to him,
to whom he gave an Account of _Misson_'s Settlement: They invited him
into the Wood to see that of theirs, and to advise with their
Companions, about the propos'd Migration. The Governor, _aliàs_
Quarter-Master, received him mighty civilly, but told him, that he could
see no Advantage to themselves in changing their present Situation, tho'
they might prove a great One to the new Colony, by adding to their Force
so many brave Fellows: That they there enjoy'd all the Necessaries of
Life; were free and independent of all the World; and it would be
Madness again to subject themselves to any Government, which, however
mild, still exerted some Power. That he was Governor for three Months,
by the Choice of his Companions; but his Power extended no farther than
to the judging in Matters of small Difference which might arise, which
he hop'd to do impartially while his Authority continued; that they had
agreed among themselves, and confirm'd that Agreement by Oath, to
support the Decrees of the Governor for the Time, that their
Tranquillity might not be disturb'd by the capricious Humour of any one
Man; and that this Power of determining, was to devolve at the
Expiration of three Months, to him on whom the Lot should fall by
balloting, provided he had not before enjoyed the Honour, for such a one
was not to draw; by which Agreement, every one would be raised, in Time,
to the supream Command, which prevented all canvassing and making
Interest for Votes, as when it determined by Suffrage; left no Open for
making Divisions and Parties, and was a Means to continue to them that
Repose inseparable from a Unity among themselves. However, continu'd he,
if you will go to _America_ or _Europe_, and shew the Advantages which
may accrue to the _English_, by fixing a Colony here, out of that Love
we bear our Country, and to wipe away the odious Appellation of Pyrates,
with Pleasure we'll submit to any who shall come with a Commission from
a lawful Government; but 'tis ridiculous to think we will become
Subjects to greater Rogues than our selves; and that you may know what
to say on this Head, if you think it expedient to follow my Advice, take
with you some few Thoughts, which I have couch'd in Writing, and which
I'll fetch you; he went into his Cabbin, for, tho' the Governor's, it
did not deserve the Name of a House, brought out some written Papers,
and gave them him.

Captain _Tew_ finding the Quarter-Master spoke the Sentiments of his
Companions, took Leave, and returned to his Ship.

When the Captain was in his Cabbin, he read the Quarter-Master's Papers,
which, as the Contents of them may oblige the curious, I shall set down.

This Island of _Madagascar_ affords all the Necessaries of Life, and
yields to none either in the Wholesomeness of the Air, or Fruitfulness
of the Soil: The Seas around it are well stor'd with Fish, the Woods
with Fowl, and the Intrails of the Earth are enrich'd with Mines of
excellent Iron, as I have learn'd from some Natives, by their having
Arms of that Metal; and, doubtless there are here both Gold and Silver
Mines in the Mountains.

The Soil will produce Sugar, Cotton, Indigo, and other Growths of our
_American_ Colonies, at a far inferior Expence, as I will make plain, by
comparing the Charge of erecting a Mill, _&c._ in _Barbadoes_, with what
it would be here.

A Windmill in _Barbadoes_ will cost 100 l. all Materials and Labour
being very dear; but here Wood and Stone may be had for Labour only; so
that with Artificers, and the needful Iron and Copper Work brought from
_Europe_, a Sugar Work may be set up for very little Money.

Negroes in _Barbadoes_ are at 30, 40, 50 l. _per_ Head; and I dare
answer 10 s. in _European_ Goods, will purchase a Negroe Slave at
_Madagascar_, since we have purchas'd for an old Coat, a lusty Fellow.

Food is very dear at _Barbadoes_, and here you may feed a Slave, as well
as your self without Expence; consequently he will do more Work than a
_Barbadoes_ Slave, who is, by the Dearness of Provision, half-starved.

Tho' a Cattle Mill is of less Expence in _Barbadoes_, yet the feeding of
Horses and Oxen at _Barbadoes_ is very dear.

But, to proceed to other Advantages, all Sorts of medicinal and dying
Woods may be carried from hence to _Europe_; and your Woods for fine
Works, as Iron, Wood, Cedar, Mahogony, _&c._ are here in great
Abundance.

If a Colony, with a lawful Power, were settled here, no doubt, but many
of the Commodities which we fetch from the _Indies_ might be made here,
as Silk, Cotton, _&c._ the Soil being proper for their Production.

The Natives are, or seem to be, very human; and they have such Plenty of
black Cattle, that we have bought an Ox of 800 lb. Weight, for a Pair of
Breeches.

Besides, a Settlement here would be a Curb on Pyrates, and a Protection,
as well as a great Conveniency to our _East India_ Ships, who might here
be stored with fresh or salt Provisions, and consequently not be obliged
to carry with them so great a Quantity as they now do, and save a great
Deal of Money to the Company in their Victualling.

Captain _Tew_ went on Shore again in the Evening, the Wind not serving
to weigh, it blowing due _West_; he asked the Governor, how he got
acquainted with the Natives? and he answered, by meeting them a Hunting,
and using them well; that he wheedled one of them down to their Huts,
the Fellow being alone, and they three in Company, he suppos'd, thought
it best to go with seeming Willingness. After him several came, and they
liv'd very friendly with them: The Captain had brought ashore with him
some Rum and Brandy, and they were drinking a Bowl of Punch, when, on a
sudden, a violent Storm arose; Captain _Tew_ ran to the Shore, and made
a Signal for his Boat to carry him off, but the Sea ran too high to
venture out of the Ship: The Storm all the while increas'd, and the
_Victoire_, in less than two Hours, parted her Cables, was drove ashore
where it was steep to, and perished, with all her Men, in Captain
_Tew_'s Sight.

The Captain staid with his old Companions, without knowing which Way to
return to his Friends he had left with _Misson_, not one of whom was
(luckily for them,) on board the Ship. At the End of three Months, as
far as they could discover a Hutt, they saw a large Ship, which _Tew_
believed was the _Bijoux_; but she took no Notice of the Fires they
made: As he expected she would return after a short Cruize, he, and his
Companions, made large Fires every Night on the Shore, and visited the
Coast very often. About a Month after this, as they came early to the
Sea-Side, they were surpriz'd at the Sight of two Sloops which lay at an
Anchor, about a Canon Shot from the Shore; they had not been long
looking upon them, when a Canoe was hoisted out of One, and made to
them, with six Men who row'd, and one Sitter.

_Tew_ soon knew him to be Captain _Misson_; he came ashore, and
embracing the former, told him, all their propos'd Happiness was
vanished; for without the least Provocation given, in the Dead of the
Night, the Natives came down upon them in two great Bodies, and made a
great Slaughter, without Distinction of Age or Sex, before they could
put themselves in a Posture of Defence; that _Caraccioli_ (who died in
the Action) and he got what Men together they could, to make a Stand;
but finding all Resistance vain against such Numbers, he made a Shift to
secure a considerable Quantity of rough Diamonds and Bar Gold, and to
get on board the two Sloops with 45 Men: That the _Bijoux_ being gone to
cruize, and the Number of Men he had carried with him in the _Victoire_,
weaken'd the Colony, and given the Natives the Boldness to attack them
as they did, but for what Reason he could not imagine.

_Tew_ gave him an Account of the Disaster which had happen'd; and after
having mutually condol'd their Misfortunes, _Tew_ propos'd their going
to _America_, where _Misson_ might, with the Riches he had, pass his
Life unknown, and in a comfortable Manner.

_Misson_ answer'd he could not yet take any Resolution, tho' he had
Thoughts of returning to _Europe_, and privately visiting his Family, if
any where alive, and then to retire from the World.

They dined with the Quarter-Master, who press'd their Return to
_America_, to procure a Commission for the settling a Colony.

_Misson_ told _Tew_, he should have one of the Sloops, and what
Volunteers would keep him Company, for his Misfortunes had erased all
Thoughts of future Settlements; that what Riches they had saved, he
would distribute equally, nay, he would be content, if he had only a
bare Support left him.

On this Answer, four of the Quarter-Master's Company offer'd to join
Captain _Tew_.

In the Afternoon they visited both Sloops, and _Misson_ putting the
Question to the Men, thirty went on board of one Sloop, tho' they parted
with great Reluctance from their old Commander; and fifteen staid with
_Misson_. The four Men who join'd _Tew_ made the Number of his Crew 34;
they staid about a Week, in hopes of the _Bijoux_'s Return upon the
Coast; but she not appearing, they set sail, Captain _Misson_ having
first shared the Treasure, with _Tew_ and his other Friends and
Companions, hoping to meet the _Bijoux_ on the _Guiney_ Coast, for which
they shaped their Course.

Off Cape _Infantes_, they were over-taken with a Storm, in which the
unhappy _Misson_'s Sloop went down, within a Musket Shot of Captain
_Tew_, who could give him no Assistance.

_Tew_ continued his Course for _America_, and arrived at _Rhode Island_
without any Accident; his Men dispersed themselves, as they thought fit,
and _Tew_ sent to _Bermudas_ for his Owners Account fourteen Times the
Value of their Sloop, and not being questioned by any, liv'd in great
Tranquillity; the _French_ belonging to _Misson_, took different Routs,
one of whom dying at _Rochelle_, the _French_ Manuscript of _Misson_'s
Life was found among his Papers, and transmitted to me by a Friend and
Correspondent.

Captain _Tew_ lived unquestion'd, _&c._ he had an easy Fortune, and
designed to live quietly at home; but those of his Men, who lived near
him, having squandered their Shares, were continually solliciting him to
take another Trip: He withstood their Request a considerable Time; but
they having got together (by the Report they made of the vast Riches to
be acquired) a Number of resolute Fellows, they, in a Body, begg'd him
to head them but for one Voyage. They were so earnest in their Desire,
that he could not refuse complying. They prepared a small Sloop, and
made the best of their Way to the _Streights_, entering the _Red Sea_,
where they met with, and attack'd a Ship belonging to the Great _Mogul_;
in the Engagement, a Shot carried away the Rim of _Tew_'s Belly, who
held his Bowels with his Hands some small Space; when he dropp'd, it
struck such a Terror in his Men, that they suffered themselves to be
taken, without making Resistance.


                                   OF
                            Capt. _HALSEY_,
                             And his CREW.

_John Halsey_ was a _Boston_ Man, of _New England_, commanded the
_Charles_ Brigantine, and went out with a Commission from the Governor,
to cruize on the Banks of _Newfoundland_, where he took a _French_
Banker, which he appointed to meet him at _Fyal_; but missing his Prize
here, he went among the _Canary_ Islands, where he took a _Spanish
Barcalonga_, which he plundered and sunk; from thence he went to the
Island of _Bravo_, one of the _Cape de Verd_, where he wooded and
watered, turn'd ashore his Lieutenant, and several of his Men here
running away from him, the Governor sent them on board again, his
Commission being as yet in Force; from hence he stood away then to the
Southward, and doubling the _Cape_ of _Good Hope_, made for _Madagascar_
and the Bay of _Augustine_, where he took in Wood and Water, with some
straggling Seamen, who were cast away in the _Degrave India_ Man, Capt.
_Young_, Commander. After this, he shap'd his Course for the _Red Sea_,
and met with a _Dutchman_ of 60 Guns, coming from _Mocha_, whom he kept
Company with a Week. Tho' he was resolved upon turning Pyrate, he
intended to rob only the _Moor_ Ships, which occasioned a Dispute
between him and his Men; they insisting on the Ship's being a _Moor_, he
as strenuously asserting she was _Dutch_, was positive in his Resolve of
meddling with no _European_ Ships. The Men were for boarding, but his
Obstinacy not being to be conquered, they broke _Halsey_ and his Gunner,
confining both, and were ready to board the _Dutchman_, when one of the
Crew perceiving he was about to run out his lower Tire, knock'd down the
Quarter-Master (whose Business it is to be at the Helm in Time of Chase
or Engagement, according to the Rules of Pyrates) clapp'd the Helm hard
a Weather, and wore the _Brigantine_: The _Dutchman_ staid, and fired a
Shot, which taking a Swivel Gun carried it aft, narrowly miss'd the Man
at Helm, and shatter'd the Tafrel; the Men perceiving they had catch'd a
_Tartar_, made the best of their Way to shake her off, and some were
running down between Decks, whom the Surgeon prick'd up again with his
Sword, tho' he no Way was consenting to their design'd Pyracy. The
Captain and a Gunner were again reinstated after they had seen their
Mistake, and then they steer'd for the _Nicobar_ Islands, where they met
with a Country Ship, called the _Buffalo_, commanded by Captain
_Buckley_, an _Englishman_, coming from _Bengal_, which they took after
a short Engagement, there being only three _Europeans_ aboard, the
Captain and two Mates, the rest were _Moors_. This Ship fell seasonably
in their Way, she being bound for _Achen_, with Butter, Rice, and
Cloath, and the Pyrates, at that Time, being in great Streights both for
Provision and Cloathing. They took the two Mates to Sea with them, but
left the Captain and the _Moors_ at _Cara Nicobar_, at an Anchor, and
then took a Cruize. Captain _Buckley_, who was sick, died before their
Return; in the Cruize they met with Captain _Collins_ in a Country
Sloop, bound also to _Achen_: He had also two _English_ Mates with him,
but the rest of his Company consisted of _Moors_; him they carried to
the same Harbour where they left the _Buffalo_.

Here a Dispute arose among the Pyrates, some were for returning to the
_West Indies_, others were against it, for they had got no Money, and
that was what engaged their Search; they parted upon this; one Part went
on board the _Buffalo_, made one _Rowe_ Captain, and _Myers_, a
_Frenchman_, Master, whom they had pick'd up at _Madagascar_. The
Sloop's Deck they ripp'd up, and mended with it the Bottom of the
_Brigantine_, which _Halsey_ still commanded; the Ship shaped her Course
for _Madagascar_, and the _Brigantine_ made for the Streights of
_Malacca_, to lie in the Tract of the _Manila_ Ships. I must observe,
that Capt. _Buckley_'s two Mates, whom they intended to force with them,
were by Strength of Intreaty, permitted to go away with a Canoe. In
these Streights, they met an _Europe_ built Ship, of 26 Guns, which they
had not the Courage to attack, being sour'd by the _Dutchman_. They
afterwards stood in Shore, and came to an Anchor; few Days after they
made a Vessel, which they supposed a _China_ Jonque, and gave Chase, but
when they came pretty nigh, notwithstanding the Pilot assured them, she
was what they supposed, they swore it was a _Dutchman_, and would not
venture upon him; so leaving off their Chase stood in Shore, and came
again to an Anchor under the _Peninsula_; they lay here some Days, and
then spied a tall Vessel, which they chased, and proved the _Albemarle
East India_ Man, Captain _Bews_, Commander, come from _China_; they came
up with him, but thinking it too warm a Ship, after exchanging a few
Shot, the _Brigantine_ made off, and the _Albemarle_ chased in her Turn:
They however got clear, having a better Share of Heels, and came again
to an Anchor, having not above 40 Hands, their Water growing scarce, and
not daring to venture ashore for Fear of the _Dutch_, a Council was
called, and it was resolved to make the best of their Way to
_Madagascar_, to pick up more Hands, refresh, and set out on new
Adventures; pursuant to this Resolution, they steer'd for that Island,
but fell in their Way on _Mascarenas_ where, making a small Present to
the Governor, they were supplied with what they wanted; from hence they
went to a Place on _Madagascar_, call'd by the Pyrates _Hopeful Point_;
by the Natives, _Harangby_, near the Island of St. _Mary_'s, on the Lat.
of 17. 40 S. where they met with the _Buffalo_, and the _Dorothy_, a
Prize, made by Captain _Thomas White_ and his Company, being about 90 or
100 Men, settled near the same Place, in petty Governments of their own,
having some of them 500 or 600, some 1000 Negroe Subjects, who
acknowledged their Sovereignty. Here they again repaired their
Brigantine, took in Provisions and all Necessaries, augmented their
Company to about 100 Men, and set out for the _Red Sea_; they touch'd at
_Johanna_, and there took in a Quantity of Goats and Cocoa Nuts for
fresh Provisions, and thence in eleven Days reach'd the Streights of
_Babel Mandel_: They had not cruised here many Days, when they spied the
_Moors_ Fleet from _Mocha_ and _Jufa_, consisting of 25 Sail, which they
fell in with, and had been taken, if their Oars had not help'd them off,
it falling a dead Calm. They had not apprehended the Danger so great, if
they had not judged these Ships convoy'd by some _Portuguese_ Men of
War: Some Days after this, they met a one Mast Vessel, called a Grab,
coming from _Mocha_, which they spied within Gun-Shot, in a thick Fog;
they fired a Shot which out her Halliards, and then they took Possession
of her with their Boats; she was laden with Drugs, but they took only
some Necessaries and 2000 Dollars, and having learned that 4 _English_
Vessels lay at _Mocoa_, of which one was from _Jufa_, they let her go.

Three Days after they spied the 4 Ships, which they at first took for
the Trees of _Babel Mandel_; at Night they fell in with, and kept them
Company till Morning, the Trumpets sounding on both Sides all the Time,
for the Pyrate had two on board as well as the _English_. When it was
clear Day the four Ships drew into a Line, for they had haled the
Pyrate, who made no Ceremony of owning who he was, by answering
according to their Manner _From the Seas_. The _Brigantine_ bore up till
she had slung her Garf. One of the Ships perceiving this, advised
Captain _Jago_, who led the Van, in a Ship of 24 Guns and 70 Men, to
give Chace, for the Pyrate was on the Run; but a Mate, who was
acquainted with the Way of working among Pyrates, answered he would find
his Mistake, and said he had seen many a warm Day, but feared this would
be the hottest. The _Brigantine_ turn'd up again, and coming a Stern,
clapp'd the _Rising Eagle_ aboard, a Ship of 16 Guns and the Sternmost;
tho' they entered their Men, the _Rising Eagle_ held them a warm Dispute
for 3 Quarters of an Hour, in which Captain _Chamberlain_'s chief Mate
and several others were killed, the Purser was wounded, jumped
over-board, and drowned: In the mean while the other Ships call'd to
Captain _Jago_ to board the Pyrate; who bearing away, to clap him
aboard, the Pyrate gave him a Shot, which raked him fore and aft, and
determined Captain _Jago_ to get out of Danger; for he run away with all
the Sail he could pack, tho' he was fitted out to protect the Coast
against Pyrates. His Example was followed by the rest, every one
steering a different Course: Thus they became Masters of the _Rising
Eagle_. I can't but take Notice, that the second Mate of the _Rising
Eagle_, after Quarters were called for, fired from out of the
Forecastle, and killed two of the Pyrates, one of whom was the Gunner's
Consort, who would have revenged his Death by shooting the Mate, but
several _Irish_ and _Scots_, together with one Captain _Thomas White_,
once a Commander among the Pyrates, but then a private Man, interposed
and saved him, in regard that he was an _Irishman_. They examined the
Prisoners to know which was the Ship came from _Juffa_, for that had
Money on board; and having learn'd it was the _Essex_, they gave Chace,
came up with her, hoisted the bloody Flag at the Mainmast-head, fired
one single Gun, and she struck; tho' the _Essex_ was fitted for close
Quarters, there were not on board the _Brigantine_ above 20 Hands, and
the Prize was a Stern so far, that her Top-mast scarce appeared out of
the Water; in chacing this Ship, they pass'd the other two, who held the
Fly of their Ensigns in their Hands ready to strike. When the Ship had
struck, the Captain of her asked who commanded that _Brigantine_, he was
answered, Captain _Halsey_; asking again who was Quarter-Master? He was
told, _Nathaniel North_, to whom he called, as he knew him very well.
_North_ learning his Name was _Punt_, said Captain _Thomas Punt, I am
sorry you are fallen into our Hands_; he was civilly treated, and
nothing belonging to himself or the _English_ Gentlemen, who were
Passengers, touch'd, tho' they made bold to lay Hands on 40000 l. in
Money belonging to the Ship. They had about 10000 l. in Money out of the
_Rising Eagle_. They discharged the _Essex_, and with the other Prize
and the Brigantine, steer'd for _Madagascar_, where they arrived and
shared their Booty. Some of the Passengers, who had been so well
treated, came afterwards with a small Ship from _India_ (with License
from the Governor of _Maderas_) called the _Greyhound_, laden with
Necessaries, in Hopes to barter with the Pyrates for the dry Goods they
had taken, and recover them at an easy Rate: They were received very
kindly, an Invoice of their Goods was asked, the Goods agreed for,
shared and paid in Money and Bale Goods. In the mean while came in a
Ship from _Scotland_, called the _Neptune_, 26 Guns, 54 Men, commanded
by Captain _James Miller_, with a Design to slave, and to go thence to
_Batavia_ to dispose of her Negroes (having a Supercargo on board,
brought up among the _Dutch_) and thence to _Malacco_, to take on board
the Cargo of a Ship, call'd the _Speedwell_, lost on her Return from
_China_; but finding here another Ship trading with the Pyrates, and
having many Necessaries, _French_ Brandy, _Madera_ Wine, and _English_
Stout on board, Captain _Miller_ thought it better to trade for Money
than Slaves. The Merchants of the _Greyhound_ nettled to see any but
themselves take Money, for the Pyrates never haggled about a Price, told
'em, They could not do the Governor of _Maderas_ a more grateful Piece
of Service, than to make Prize of the _Neptune_, which was a Ship fit
for their Purpose. To which some of the _Scotch_ and _Irish_ answered,
they had not best put such a Design on Foot, for if the Company once got
it into their Heads to take one, they'd go nigh to take both Ships. In a
short Time after came on a Hurricane, which obliged the _Neptune_ to cut
away all her Masts, and lost the three Ships belonging to the Pyrates,
which was their whole Fleet. They having now no Ship, and several of
them no Money, having been stripp'd at Play, their Thoughts were bent on
the _Neptune_. The Chief Mate of her _Daniel Burgis_, who had a Spleen
to the Captain, joining privately with the Pyrates (among whom he died)
got all the small Masts and Yards ashore; and the Pyrates being
requested to find him proper Trees for Masting, told Captain _Miller_,
they had found such as would serve his Turn, desiring he would take a
Number of Hands ashore to get them down to the Water, which he
(suspecting no harm) accordingly did, and he and his Men were seized,
and the Long Boat detained ashore. The Captain was forced to send for
the second Mate, and afterwards for the Gunner; the Mate, who was the
Captain's Brother, went, but the Gunner suspecting foul Play refused: In
the Evening _Burgess_ came on board, and advised the Surrender of the
Ship, which, tho' but sixteen were left on board, they scrupled, and
proposed going under the Cover of their own Guns to fetch their
Top-masts and Yards, and with them to put to Sea; but the Chief Mate
_Burgess_, whose Villany was not then known, persuaded them to give up a
Ship they could neither defend nor sail; which was no small Satisfaction
to the Merchants in the _Greyhound_, little thinking how soon they would
meet with the same Treatment; for two Days after the Pyrates mann'd the
_Neptune_'s Pinnace, seized the _Greyhound_, took away all the Money
they had paid, and shifting out of the _Neptune_ ten Pipes of _Madera_,
with two Hogsheads of Brandy, into the _Greyhound_, and putting on board
the Captain, second Mate, Boatswain and Gunner of the _Neptune_, and
about 14 of her Hands, ordered her to Sea; the rest of the _Neptune_'s
Company being young Men fit for their Purpose, they detained, most of
which, by hard drinking, fell into Distempers and died. As to Captain
_Halsey_, while the _Scotch_ Ship was fitting, he fell ill of a Fever,
died and was buried with great Solemnity and Ceremony; the Prayers of
the Church of _England_ were read over him, Colours were flying, and his
Sword and Pistol laid on his Coffin, which was covered with a Ship's
Jack; as many Minute Guns fired as he was Years old, _viz._ 46, and
three _English_ Vollies, and one _French_ Volley of small Arms. He was
brave in his Person, courteous to all his Prisoners, lived beloved, and
died regretted by his own People. His Grave was made in a Garden of
Water Melons, and fenced in with Pallisades to prevent his being rooted
up by wild Hogs, of which there are Plenty in those Parts.

_P. S._ The _Neptune_ seized as above, was the Year after Captain
_Halsey_'s Death, ready to go to Sea; but a Hurricane happening she was
lost, and prov'd the last Ship that Gang of Pyrates ever got Possession
of.


                                   OF
                        Captain _Thomas White_,
                             And his CREW.

He was born at _Plymouth_, where his Mother kept a Publick House; she
took great Care of his Education and when he was grown up, as he had an
Inclination to the Sea, procur'd him the King's Letter. After he had
served some Years on board a Man of War, he went to _Barbadoes_, where
he married, got into the Merchants Service, and designed to settle in
the Island: He had the Command of the _Marygold Brigantine_ given him,
in which he made two successful Voyages to _Guiney_ and back to
_Barbadoes_; in his third, he had the Misfortune to be taken by a
_French_ Pyrate, as were several other _English_ Ships, the Masters and
inferior Officers of which they detained, being in Want of good Artists.

The Brigantine belonging to _White_ they kept for their own Use, and
sunk the Vessel they before sailed in; but meeting with a Ship on the
_Guiney_ Coast more fit for their Purpose, they went on board her, and
burnt the Brigantine.

It is not my Business here to give an Acount of this _French_ Pyrate,
any farther than Captain _White_'s Story obliges me, tho' I beg Leave to
take Notice of their Barbarity to the _English_ Prisoners, for they
would set them up as a Butt or Mark to shoot at; several of whom were
thus murdered in cool Blood, by Way of Diversion.

_White_ was marked out for a Sacrifice by one of these Villains, who,
for I know not what Reason, had sworn his Death, which he escaped thus.
One of the Crew, who had a Friendship for _White_, knew this Fellow's
Design, to kill him in the Night, and therefore advised him to lye
between him and the Ship's Side, with Intention to save him; which
indeed he did, but was himself shot dead by the murderous Villain, who
mistook him for _White_; but this by the Bye.

After some Time cruizing along the Coast, the Pyrates doubled the _Cape_
of _Good Hope_, and shaped their Course for _Madagascar_, where, being
drunk and mad, they knock'd their Ship on the Head, at the _South_ End
of the Island, at a Place called by the Natives _Elexa_; the Country
thereabouts was governed by a King, named _Mafaly_.

When the Ship struck, Captain _White_, Captain _Boreman_, (born in the
Isle of _White_, formerly a Lieutenant of a Man of War, but in the
Merchants Service when he fell into the Hands of the Pyrates) Captain
_Bowen_ and some other Prisoners got to the Long-Boat, and with broken
Oars and Barrel Staves, which they found in the Bottom of the Boat,
paddled to _Augustine_ Bay; that is about 14 or 15 Leagues from the
Wreck where they landed, and were kindly received by the King of _Bavaw_
(the Name of that Part of the Island) who spoke good _English_.

They staid here a Year and a half at the King's Expence, who gave them a
plentiful Allowance of Provision, as was his Custom to all White Men,
who met with any Misfortune on his Coast; his Humanity not only provided
for all such, but the first _European_ Vessel that came in, he always
obliged them to take in the unfortunate People, let the Vessel be what
it would; for he had no Notion of any Difference between Pyrates and
Merchants.

At the Expiration of the above Term, a Pyrate Brigantine came in, aboard
which the King obliged them to enter, or travel by Land to some other
Place, which they durst not do; and of two Evils chose the least, that
of going on board the Pyrate Vessel, which was commanded by one _William
Read_, who received them very civilly.

This Commander went along the Coast, and pick'd up what _Europeans_ he
could meet with; his Crew however did not exceed forty Men, he would
have been glad of taking on board some of the wreck'd _Frenchmen_, but
for the Barbarity they had used towards the _English_ Prisoners;
however, it was impracticable, for the _French_ pretending to lord it
over the Natives, whom they began to treat inhumanly, were set upon by
them, one half of their Number cut off, and the other half made Slaves.

_Read_, with this Gang, and a Brigantine of 60 Tons, steer'd his Course
for the Gulf of _Persia_, where they met a Grabb (a one masted Vessel)
of about 200 Tons, which was made Prize.

They found nothing on board but Bale Goods, most of which they threw
over-board to search for Gold, and to make Room in the Vessel; but as
they learned afterwards, they threw over in their Search, what they so
greedily hunted after, for there was a considerable Quantity of Gold
concealed in one of the Bales they toss'd into the Sea.

In this Cruise Captain _Read_ fell ill and died; he was succeeded by one
_James_. The Brigantine being small, crazy, and worm eaten, they shaped
their Course for the Island of _Mayotta_, where they took out the Masts
of the Brigantine, fitted up the Grabb, and made a Ship of her: Here
they took in a Quantity of fresh Provision, which is in this Island very
plentiful, and very cheap; and found a twelve oar'd Boat, which formerly
belonged to the _Ruby East India_ Man, which had been lost there.

They staid here all the Monsoon Time, which is about six Months; after
which they resolved for _Madagascar_. As they came in with the Land,
they spied a Sail coming round from the _East_ Side of the Island; they
gave Chase on both Sides, so that they soon met: They haled each other,
and receiving the same Answer from each Vessel, _viz._ _from the Seas_,
they joined Company.

This Vessel was a small _French_ Ship, laden with Liquors from
_Martinico_, first commanded by one _Fourgette_, to trade with the
Pyrates for Slaves, at _Ambonawoula_, on the _East_ Side the Island, in
the Lat. of 17. 30. and was by them taken after the following Manner.

The Pyrates, who were headed by _George Booth_, Commander of the Ship,
went on board (as they had often done) to the Number of ten, and carried
Money with them under Pretence of purchasing what they wanted. (This
_Booth_ had formerly been Gunner of a Pyrate Ship, called the
_Dolphin_.) Captain _Fourgette_ was pretty much upon his Guard, and
searched every Man as he came over the Side, and a Pair of Pocket
Pistols were found upon a _Dutchman_, who was the first enter'd; the
Captain told him, _he was a Rogue, and had a Design upon his Ship_, and
the Pyrates pretended to be so angry with this Fellow's offering to come
on board with Arms, that they threatned to knock on the Head, and
tossing him roughly into the Boat, ordered him ashore, tho' they had
before taken an Oath on the Bible, either to carry the Ship or die in
the Undertaking.

They were all searched, but they however contrived to get on board 4
Pistols, which were all the Arms they had for the Enterprize, tho'
_Fourgette_ had 20 Hands on board, and his small Arms on the Arning to
be in Readiness.

The Captain invited them into the Cabbin to Dinner, but _Booth_ chose to
dine with the petty Officers, tho' one _Johnson_, _Isaac_, and another,
went down.

_Booth_ was to give the Watch Word, which was _Hurrah_; he pretending to
make Water over the Side of the Gunnel, laid his Hand on the Arning, and
being a nimble Fellow, at one Spring threw himself upon it, drew the
Arms to him, fired his Pistol forward among the Men, one of whom he
wounded, (who jumping over-board was lost) and gave the Signal.

Three I said were in the Cabbin, and seven upon Deck, who with
Handspikes and the Arms seized, secured the Ship's Crew. The Captain and
his two Mates, who were at Dinner in the Cabbin, hearing the Pistol,
fell upon _Johnson_, and stabb'd him in several Places with their Forks,
but they being Silver, did him no great Damage. _Fourgette_ snatch'd his
Piece which he snapp'd at _Isaac_'s Breast several Times, but it would
not go off; at last, finding his Resistance vain, he submitted, and the
Pyrates set him, and those of his Men who would not join them, on Shore,
allowing him to take his Books, Papers, and whatever else he claimed as
belonging to himself; and besides treating him very humanly gave him
several Casks of Liquor, with Arms and Powder, to purchase Provisions in
the Country.

I hope this Digression, as it was in a Manner needful, will be excused;
I shall now proceed.

After they had taken in the _Dolphin_'s Company, which were on the
Island, and encreased by that Means their Crew to the Number of 80
Hands, they sail'd to St. _Mary_'s, where Captain _Misson_'s Ship lay at
Anchor, between the Island and the Main: This Gentleman and his whole
Ship's Company had been cut off, at the Instigation of _Ort-Vantyle_, a
_Dutchman_ of _New-York_.

Out of her they took Water Casks and other Necessaries, which having
done, they designed for the River _Methelage_, on the West Side
_Madagascar_, in the Lat. of 16 or thereabouts, to salt up Provisions
and to proceed to the _East Indies_, cruize off the Islands of St.
_John_, and lie in Wait for the _Moors_ Ships from _Mocha_.

In their Way to _Methelage_ they fell in (as I have said) with the
Pyrate, on board of which was Captain _White_; they join'd Company, came
to an Anchor together in the above-nam'd River, where they had cleaned,
salted up, taken in their Provisions, and were ready to go to Sea, when
a large Ship appeared in Sight, and stood into the same River.

The Pyrates knew not whether she was a Merchant Man or Man of War; she
had been the latter, belonging to the _French_ King, and could mount 50
Guns; but being taken by the _English_, she was bought by some _London_
Merchants, and fitted out from that Port, to slave at _Madagascar_, and
go to _Jamaica_. The Captain was a young unexperienced Man, who was put
in with a Nurse.

The Pyrates sent their Boats to speak with him, but the Ship firing at
them, they concluded it a Man of War, and rowed to Shore, the two
Pyrates slipp'd and run ashore; the Grabb standing in, and not keeping
her Wind so well as the _French_ built Ship, run among a Parcel of
Mangroves, and a Stump piercing her Bottom, she sunk; the other run
aground, let go her Anchor, and came to no Damage, for the Tide of Flood
fetch'd her off.

The Captain of the _Speaker_, for that was the Name of the Ship which
frighten'd the Pyrates, was not a little vain of having forced these two
Vessels ashore, tho' he did not know whether they were Pyrates or
Merchant Men, and could not help expressing himself in these Words; _How
will my Name ring on the_ Exchange, _when it is known I have run two
Pyrates aground_, which gave Handle to a satyrical Return from one of
his Men after he was taken, who said, _Lord, How our Captain's Name will
ring on the_ Exchange, _when it is heard, he frighten'd two Pyrate Ships
ashore, and was taken by their two Boats afterwards_.

When the _Speaker_ came within Shot, she fired several at the two
Vessels; and when she came to an Anchor, several more into the Country,
which alarm'd the Negroes, who, acquainting their King, he would allow
him no Trade, till the Pyrates living ashore, and who had a Design on
his Ship, interceded for 'em, telling the King, they were their
Countrymen, and what had happened was thro' a Mistake, it being a Custom
among them to fire their Guns by Way of Respect, and it was owing to the
Gunner of the Ship's Negligence, that they fir'd Shot.

The Captain of the _Speaker_ sent his Purser ashore, to go up the
Country to the King, who lived about 24 Miles from the Coast, to carry a
couple of small Arms inlaid with Gold, a couple of Brass Blunderbusses,
and a Pair of Pistols, as Presents, and to require Trade.

As soon as the Purser was ashore, he was taken Prisoner, by one _Tom
Collins_, a _Welchman_, born in _Pembroke_, who lived on Shore, and had
belong'd to the _Charming Mary_ of _Barbadoes_, which went out with a
Commission, but was converted to a Pyrate; he told the Purser, he was
his Prisoner, and must answer the Damage done two Merchants, who were
slaving.

The Purser answer'd, that he was not Commander, that the Captain was a
hot rash Youth, put into a Business by his Friends, which he did not
understand; but however, Satisfaction should be made.

He was carried by _Collins_ on board _Booth_'s Ship, where, at first, he
was talked to in pretty strong Terms; but after a while very civilly
us'd, and the next Morning sent up to the King with a Guide, and Peace
made for him, as already said.

The King allowed them Trade, and sent down the usual Presents, a couple
of Oxen, between 20 and 30 People laden with Rice, and as many more with
the Country Liquor, called _Toke_.

The Captain then settled the Factory on the Shore Side, and began to buy
Slaves and Provisions; the Pyrates were among them, and had
Opportunities of sounding the Men, and knowing in what Posture the Ship
lay. They found by one _Hugh Man_, belonging to the _Speaker_, that
there were not above 40 Men on board, and that they had lost the second
Mate and 20 Hands in the Long Boat, on the Coast, before they came into
this Harbour, but that they kept a good Look-out, and had their Guns
ready primed; however, he, for a hundred Pounds, undertook to wet all
the Priming, and assist in the taking the Ship.

After some Days the Captain of the _Speaker_ came on Shore, and was
received with a great Deal of Civility by the Heads of the Pyrates,
having agreed before to make Satisfaction; in a Day or two after, he was
invited by them to eat a Barbacute Shoot, which Invitation he accepted.

After Dinner, Captain _Bowen_, who was, I have already said, a Prisoner
on board the _French_ Pyrate, but now become one of the Fraternity, and
Master of the _Grab_, went out, and returned with a Case of Pistols in
his Hand, and told the Captain of the _Speaker_, whose Name I won't
mention, that he was his Prisoner; he asked, upon what Account? _Bowen_
answered, they wanted a Ship, his was a good One, and they were resolved
to have her, to make amends for the Damage he had done them.

In the mean while his Boats Crew, and the rest of his Men ashore, were
told by other of the Pyrates, who were drinking with them, that they
were also Prisoners; some of them answer'd, _Z--ds, we don't trouble our
Heads what we are, let's have t'other Bowl of Punch_.

A Watch Word was given, and no Boat to be admitted on board the Ship;
this Word, which was for that Night, _Coventry_, was known to them: At
Eight a-Clock they mann'd the twelve-oar'd Boat, and that they found at
_Mayotta_, with 24 Men, and set out for the Ship.

When they were put off, the Captain of the _Speaker_ desired them to
come back, he wanted to speak with them; Captain _Booth_ asked, what he
wanted? He said, they could never take his Ship, then said _Booth_,
we'll die in or along Side of her; but replied the Captain, if you will
go with Safety, don't board on the Lar-board Side, for there is a Gun
out of the Steerage loaden with Patridge, will clear the Decks; they
thank'd him, and proceeded.

When they were near the Ship they were haled, and the Answer was, _the
Coventry_; all well, said the Mate, get the Lights over the Side, but
spying the second Boat, he asked what Boat that was? one answered, it
was a Raft of Water, another, that it was a Boat of Beef; this
Disagreement in the Answers made the Mate suspicious, who cried out
_Pyrates, take to your Arms my Lads_, and immediately clapp'd a Match to
a Gun, which, as the Priming was before wet by the Treachery of _Hugh
Man_, only fizz'd; they boarded in the Instant, and made themselves
Masters of her, without the Loss of a Man on either Side.

The next Day they put necessary Provisions on board the _French_ built
Ship, and gave her to the Captain of the _Speaker_, and those Men who
would go off with him, among whom was _Man_, who had betray'd his Ship;
for the Pyrates had both paid him the 100 l. agreed, and kept his
Secret. The Captain having thus lost his Ship, sail'd in that the
Pyrates gave him, for _Johanna_, where he fell ill and died with Grief.

The Pyrates having here victualled, they sail'd for the Bay of St.
_Augustine_, where they took in between 70 and 80 Men, who had belonged
to the Ship _Alexander_, commanded by Captain _James_, a Pyrate; they
also took up her Guns, and mounted the _Speaker_ with 54, which made up
their Number 240 Men besides Slaves, of which they had about 20.

From hence they sailed for the _East Indies_, but stopp'd at _Zanguebar_
for fresh Provisions, where the _Portuguese_ had once a Settlement, but
now inhabited by _Arabians_; some of them went ashore with the Captain
to buy Provisions, the Captain was sent for by the Governor, who went
with about 14 in Company: They past thro' the Guard, and when they were
entered the Governor's House, they were all cut off; and, at the same
Time, others who were in different Houses of the Town were set upon,
which made them fly to the Shore; the Long-Boat, which lay off at a
Grapling, was immediately put in by those who look'd after her: There
were not above half a dozen of the Pyrates who brought their Arms
ashore, but they plyed them so well, for they were in the Boat, that
most of the Men got into her, the Quarter-Master ran down Sword in Hand,
and tho' he was attack'd by many, he behaved himself so well, that he
got into a little Canoe, put her off and reached the Long-Boat.

In the Interim, the little Fort the _Arabians_ had, play'd upon the
Ship, which returned the Salute very warmly. Thus they got on board,
with the Loss of Captain _Booth_ and twenty Men, and set Sail for the
_East-Indies_.

When they were under Sail, they went to Voting for a new Captain, and
the Quarter-Master, who had behaved so well in the last Affair with the
_Arabians_, was chosen; but he declining all Command, the Crew made
Choice of _Bowen_ for Captain, _Pickering_ to succeed him as Master,
_Samuel Herault_, a _Frenchman_, for Quarter-Master, and _Nathaniel
North_, for Captain Quarter-Master.

Things being thus settled, they came to the Mouth of the _Red Sea_, and
fell in with 13 Sail of _Moors_ Ships, which they kept Company with the
greater Part of the Day, but were afraid to venture on them as they took
them for _Portuguese_ Men of War; at length part were for boarding, and
advised it, the Captain, tho' he said little, did not seem inclin'd, for
he was but a young Pyrate, tho' an old Commander of a Merchant Man.

Those who push'd for boarding then, desired Captain _Boreman_, already
mentioned, to take the Command; but he said, he would not usurp on any,
that no Body was more fit for it than he who had it, that for his Part,
he would stand by his Fusil and went forward to the Forecastle with such
as would have had him taken the Command, to be ready to board; on which,
the Captain's Quarter-Master said, if they were resolved to engage their
Captain, (whose Representative he was) did not want Resolution,
therefore, he ordered them to get their Tacks on board (for they had
already made a clear Ship) and get ready for boarding; which they
accordingly did, and coming up with the sternmost Ship, they fired a
Broadside into her, which killed two _Moors_, clapp'd her on board and
carried her; but Night coming on, they made only this Prize, which
yielded them 500 l. _per_ Man.

From hence they sailed to the Coast of _Mallabar_; the Adventures of
these Pyrates on this Coast are already set down in Captain _Bowen_'s
Life, to which I refer the Reader, and shall only observe, Captain
_White_ was all this while afore the Mast, being a forced Man from the
Beginning.

_Bowen_'s Crew dispersing, Captain _White_ went to _Methelage_, where he
lived ashore with the King, not having any Opportunity of getting off
the Island, till another Pyrate Ship, called the _Prosperous_, commanded
by one _Thomas Howard_, who had been bred a Lighterman on the River of
_Thames_, came in: This Ship was taken at _Augustine_, by some Pyrates
from Shore, and the Crew of their own Long-Boat, which join'd them, at
the Instigation of one _Ranten_, Boatswain's Mate, who was sent for
Water. They came on board in the Night and surprized her, tho' not
without Resistance, in which the Captain and chief Mate was killed, and
several others wounded, the Particulars of which will be found in
_Hore_'s Life. Those who were ashore with Captain _White_, resolving to
enter in this Ship, determined him to go also, rather than be left alone
with the Natives, hoping, by some Accident or other, to have an
Opportunity of returning home. He continu'd on board this Ship, in which
he was made Quarter-Master, till they met with, and all went on board of
_Bowen_, as is set down in his Life, in which Ship he continued after
_Bowen_ left them, as shall be mentioned in the Appendix. At _Port
Dolphin_ he went off in the Boat to fetch some of the Crew left ashoar,
the Ship being blown to Sea the Night before. The Ship not being able to
get in, and he supposing her gone to the West-Side of the Island, as
they had formerly proposed, he steered that Course in his Boat with 26
Men. They touch'd at _Augustine_ expecting the Ship, but she not
appearing in a Week, the Time they waited, the King order'd 'em to be
gone, telling 'em they impos'd on him with Lies, for he did not believe
they had any Ship; however, he gave 'em fresh Provision. They took in
Water, and made for _Methelage_. Here, as Captain _White_ was known to
the King, they were kindly received, and staid about a Fortnight in
Expectation of their Ship, but she not appearing, they raised their Boat
a-streak, salted up the Provisions the King gave 'em, put Water aboard,
and stood for the North-End of the Island, designing to go round,
believing their Ship might be at the Island of St. _Mary_. When they
came to the North-End, the Current, which sets to the North-West for
eight Months in the Year, was so strong they found it impossible to get
round. Wherefore they got into a Harbour, of which there are many for
small Vessels. Here they staid about three Weeks or a Month, when part
of the Crew were for burning the Boat, and for travelling over Land to a
black King of their Acquaintance, whose Name was _Reberimbo_, who lived
at a Place called _Manangaromasigh_, in the Latitude of 15, or
thereabouts. As this King had been several times assisted by the Whites
in his Wars, he was a great Friend to them. Captain _White_ disswaded
them from this Undertaking, and, with much ado, saved the Boat; but one
half of the Men being resolved to go by Land, they took what Provisions
they thought necessary, and set out, Captain _White_, and those who
staid with him, convoy'd 'em a Day's Journey, and then returning, he got
into the Boat with his Companions, and went back to _Methelage_, fearing
these Men might return, prevail with the rest, and burn the Boat.

Here he built a Deck on his Boat, and lay by three Months, in which Time
there came in three Pyrates with a Boat, who had formerly been trepann'd
on board the _Severn_ and _Scarborough_ Men of War, which had been
looking for Pyrates on the East-Side; from which Ships they made their
escape at _Mohila_, in a small Canoe to _Johanna_, and from _Johanna_ to
_Mayotta_, where the King built 'em the Boat which brought 'em to
_Methelage_. The Time of the Current's setting with Violence to the
North-West being over, they proceeded together in _White_'s Boat
(burning that of _Mayotta_) to the North-End, where the Current running
yet too strong to get round, they went into a Harbour and staid there a
Month, maintaining themselves with Fish and wild Hog, of which there was
great Plenty. At length, having a Slatch of fine Weather, and the
Strength of the Current abating, they got round; and after sailing about
40 Mile on the East-Side, they went into a Harbour, where they found a
Piece of a Jacket, which they knew belong'd to one of those Men who had
left 'em to go over Land; he had been a forced Man, and a Ship
Carpenter; this they supposed he had torn to wrap round his Feet, that
Part of the Country being barren and rocky. As they sailed along this
Coast, they came to an Anchor in convenient Harbours every Night, till
they got as far as _Manangaromasigh_ where King _Reberimbo_ resided,
where they went in to enquire for their Men, who left 'em at the
North-End, and to recruit with Provisions. The latter was given 'em, but
they could have no Information of their Companions.

From hence they went to the Island of St. _Mary_, where a Canoe came off
to 'em with a Letter directed to any white Man. They knew it to be the
Hand of one of their former Ship-Mates. The Contents of this Letter was
to advise 'em to be on their Guard, and not trust too much to the Blacks
of this Place, they having been formerly treacherous. They enquired
after their Ship, and was inform'd, that the Company had given her to
the _Moors_, who were gone away with her, and that they themselves were
settled at _Ambonavoula_, about 20 Leagues to the Southward of St.
_Mary_, where they lived among the Negroes as so many sovereign Princes.

One of the Blacks, who brought off the Letter, went on board their Boat,
carried them to the Place called _Olumbah_, a Point of Land made by a
River on one Side, and the Sea on the other, where twelve of 'em lived
together in a large House they had built, and fortified with about 20
Pieces of Canon.

The rest of them were settled in small Companies of about 12 or 14
together, more or less, up the said River, and along the Coast, every
Nation by it self, as the _English_, _French_, _Dutch_, _&c._ They made
Enquiry of their Consorts after the Shares of Prizes which belong'd to
them, and they found all very justly laid by to be given them, if ever
they return'd, as were what belong'd to the Men who went over Land.
Captain _White_ hankering after home, proposed going out again in the
Boat; for he was averse to settling with them; and many others agreed to
go under his Command; and if they could not meet with a Ship to carry
them to _Europe_, to follow their old Vocation. But the others did not
think it reasonable he should have the Boat, but that it should be set
to Sale for the Benefit of the Company. Accordingly it was set up, and
Captain _White_ bought it for 400 Pieces of Eight, and with some of his
old Consorts, whose Number was increas'd by others of the Ship's Crew,
he went back the Way he had come, to _Methelage_: Here he met with a
_French_ Ship of about 50 Tuns and 6 Guns; she had been taken by some
Pyrates who lived at _Maratan_, on the East-Side of the Island, and some
of the _Degrave East-India_ Man's Crew, to whom the Master of her
refused a Passage to _Europe_; for as he had himself been a Pyrate and
Quarter-Master to _Bowen_ in the _Speaker_, he apprehended their taking
away his Ship, War being then between _England_ and _France_, he thought
they might do it without being called in question as Pyrates. The
Pyrates who had been concerned in taking _Herault_'s Ship, for that was
his Name, had gone up the Country, and left her to the Men belonging to
the _Degrave_, who had fitted her up, clean'd and tallow'd her, and got
in some Provision, with a Design to go to the _East-Indies_, that they
might light on some Ship to return to their own Country.

Captain _White_ finding these Men proposed their joining him, and going
round to _Ambonavoula_, to make up a Company, which they agreed to, and
unanimously chose him Commander. They accordingly put to Sea, and stood
away round the South End of the Island, and touch'd at _Don Mascarena_,
where he took in a Surgeon, and stretching over again to _Madagascar_,
fell in with _Ambonavoula_, and made up his Complement 60 Men. From
hence he shaped his Course for the Island of _Mayotta_, where he cleaned
his Ship, and staid for the Season to go into the _Red Seas_: His
Provisions being taken in, the Time proper, and the Ship well fitted, he
steer'd for _Babelmandel_, and running into a Harbour waited for the
_Mocha_ Ships.

He here took two Grabs laden with Provision, and having some small Money
and Drugs aboard; these he plunder'd of what was for his Turn, kept 'em
a Fortnight by him, and then let them go. Soon after they spied a tall
Ship, upon which they put to Sea; but finding her _Europe_ built, and
too strong to attempt, for it was a _Dutch_ Man, they gave over the
Chace, and were glad to shake him off, and return to their Station.
Fancying they were here discover'd, from the Coast of _Arabia_, or that
the Grabs had given Information of them, they stood over for the
_Ethiopian_ Shore, keeping a good look out for the _Mocha_ Ships.

Few Days after they met with a large Ship of about 1000 Tuns and 600
Men, called the _Malabar_, which they chased, kept Company with all
Night, and took in the Morning, with the Loss only of their Boatswain,
and two or three Men wounded. In the taking this Ship they damaged their
own so much, by springing their Foremast, carrying away their Bowsprit,
and beating in part of their upper Works, that they did not think her
longer fit for their Use, therefore filled her with Prisoners, gave 'em
Provision, and sent them away.

Some Days after this they spied a _Portuguese_ Man of War of 44 Guns,
which they chased, but gave it over, by carrying away their
Main-Top-Mast, so that they did not speak with her, for the _Portuguese_
took no Notice of them.

Four Days after they had left this Man of War, they fell in with a
_Portuguese_ Merchant-Man, which they chased with the _English_ Colours
flying, the Chace taking _White_ for an _English_ Man of War or
_East-India_ Man, made no Sail to get from him, but on his coming up
brought to, and sent his Boat on board with a Present of Sweet-Meats for
the _English_ Captain; his Boat's Crew was detain'd, and the Pyrates
getting into his Boat with their Arms, went on board, and fir'd on the
_Portuguese_, who being surprizd, asked if War was broke out between
_England_ and _Portugal_? They answer'd in the Affirmative, but the
Captain could not believe 'em. However, they took what they liked, and
kept him with them.

After two Days they met with the _Dorothy_, an _English_ Ship, Captain
_Penruddock_ Commander, coming from _Mocha_. They exchanged several Shot
in the Chace, but when they came a Long-side her, they entered their
Men, and found no Resistance, she being navigated by _Moors_, no
_Europeans_ except the Officers being on board. On a Vote they gave
Captain _Penruddock_ (from whom they took a considerable Quantity of
Money) the _Portuguese_ Ship and Cargoe, with what Bales he pleased to
take out of his own, bid him go about his Business, and make what he
could of her. As to the _English_ Ship, they kept her for their own Use.

Soon after they plunder'd the _Mallabar_ Ship, out of which they took as
much Money as came to 200 l. Sterling a man, but miss'd 50000 Chequins
which were hid in a Jar under a Cow's-Stall, kept for the giving Milk to
the _Moor_ Supercargoe, an ancient Man. They then put the _Portuguese_
and _Moor_ Prisoners on board the _Mallabar_, and sent them about their
Business. The Day after they had sent them away, one Captain _Benjamin
Stacy_, in a Ketch of six Guns fell into their Hands; they took what
Money he had, and what Goods and Provisions they wanted. Among the Money
were 500 Dollars, a Silver Mug and two Spoons belonging to a Couple of
Children on board, and under the Care of _Stacy_. The Children took on
for their Loss, and the Captain asking the Reason of their Tears, was
answer'd by _Stacy_, that the above Sum and Plate was all the Children
had to bring them up.

Captain _White_ made a Speech to his Men, and told 'em, it was cruel to
rob the innocent Children; upon which, by unanimous Consent, all was
restor'd them again; besides, they made a Gathering among themselves,
and made a Present to _Stacy_'s Mate, and other his inferior Officers,
and about 120 Dollars to the Children; they then discharged _Stacy_ and
his Crew, and made the best of their Way out of the _Red Sea_.

They came into the Bay of _Defarr_, where they found a Ketch at an
Anchor, which the People had made Prize of, by seizing the Master and
Boat's Crew ashoar. They found a _French_ Gentleman, one Monsieur
_Berger_, on board, whom they carried with 'em, took out about 2000
Dollars, and sold the Ketch to the Chief ashoar for Provisions.

Hence they sailed for _Madagascar_, but touch'd at _Mascarena_, where
several of 'em went ashoar with their Booty, about 1200 l. a Man. Here
taking in fresh Provision, _White_ steer'd for _Madagascar_, and fell in
with _Hopeful Point_, where they shar'd their Goods, and took up
Settlements ashoar, where _White_ built a House, bought Cattle, took off
the upper Deck of his Ship, and was fitting her up for the next Season.
When she was near ready for Sea, Captain _John Halsey_, who had made a
broken Voyage, came in with a Brigantine, which being a properer Vessel
for their Turn, they desisted from working on the Ship, and who had a
Mind for fresh Adventures, went on board _Halsey_, among whom Captain
_White_ enter'd afore the Mast.

At his return to _Madagascar_, _White_ was taken ill of a Flux, which in
about 5 or 6 Months ended his Days; finding his Time was drawing nigh,
he made his Will, left several Legacies, and nam'd three Men of
different Nations, Guardian to a Son he had by a Woman of the Country,
requiring he might be sent to _England_ with the Money he left him, by
the first _English_ Ship, to be brought up in the Christian Religion in
hopes he might live a better Man than his Father. He was buried with the
same Ceremony they use at the Funerals of their Companions, which is
mention'd in the Account of _Halsey_. Some Years after an _English_ Ship
touching there, the Guardians faithfully discharged their Trust, and put
him on board with the Captain, who brought up the Boy with Care, acting
by him as became a Man of Probity and Honour.


                                   OF
                           Captain _CONDENT_,
                             And his CREW.

Captain _Condent_ was a _Plymouth_ Man born, but we are as yet ignorant
of the Motives, and Time of his first turning Pyrate; he was one of
those who thought fit to retire from _Providence_ (on Governor _Roger_'s
Arrival at that Island) in a Sloop belonging to Mr. _Simpson_, of _New
York_, a _Jew_ Merchant, of which Sloop he was then Quarter-Master. Soon
after they left the Island, an Accident happened on board, which put the
whole Crew into Consternation; they had among them an _Indian_ Man, whom
some of them had beat; in revenge, he got most of the Arms forward into
the Hold, and designed to blow up the Sloop. Upon which, some advised
scuttling the Deck and throwing Grenade Shells down, but _Condent_ said,
that was too tedious and dangerous, since the Fellow might fire thro'
the Decks and kill several of them; he, therefore, taking a Pistol in
one Hand, and his Cutlash in the other, leaped into the Hold; the
_Indian_ discharged a Piece at him, which broke his Arm, but, however,
he ran up to and shot the _Indian_. When he was dead the Crew hack'd him
to Pieces, and the Gunner ripping up his Belly, tore out his Heart,
broiled and eat it.

After this, they took a Merchant Man, called, the _Duke of York_; and
some Disputes arising among the Pyrates, the Captain, and one half of
the Company, went on board the Prize; the other half, who continued in
the Sloop, chose _Condent_ Captain; he shaped his Course for the _Cape
de Verd_ Islands, and in his Way, took a Merchant Ship from _Maderas_,
laden with Wine, bound for the _West Indies_, which he plundered and let
go; then coming to the Isle of _May_, one of the said Islands, he took
the whole Salt Fleet, consisting of about 20 Sail; he wanting a Boom,
took out the Mainmast of one of these Ships, to supply the Want: Here he
took upon him the Administration of Justice, enquiring into the Manner
of the Commander's Behaviour to their Men, and those, against whom
Complaint was made, he whipp'd and pickled. He took what Provisions and
other Necessaries he wanted, and having augmented his Company, by
Voluntiers and forced Men, he left the Ships and sailed to St. _Jago_,
where he took a _Dutch_ Ship, which had formerly been a Privateer; this
prov'd also an easy Prize, for he fired but one Broadside, and clapping
her on board, carried her without Resistance, for the Captain and
several Men were killed, beside some wounded by his great Shot.

This Ship proving for his Purpose, he gave her the Name of the _Flying
Dragon_, went on board with his Crew, and made a Present of his Sloop to
a Mate of an _English_ Prize, whom he had forced with him; from hence he
stood away for the Coast of _Brazil_, and in his Cruize, took several
_Portuguese_ Ships, which he plundered and let go.

After these, he fell in with the _Wright_ Galley, Captain _John Spelt_,
Commander, hired by the _South-Sea_ Company, to go to the Coast of
_Angola_ for Slaves, and thence to _Buenos Ayres_. This Ship he detained
a considerable Time, and the Captain being his Townsman, treated him
very civilly; few Days after he took _Spelt_, he made Prize of a
_Portuguese_, laden with Bale Goods and Stores; he new rigg'd the
_Wright_ Galley, and put on board her several Goods.

Soon after he had discharged the _Portuguese_, he met with a _Dutch
East-India_ Man of 26 Guns, whose Captain was kill'd the first
Broadside, and took her with little Resistance, for he had hoisted the
Pyrates Colours on board _Spelt_'s Ship.

He now, with three Sail, steer'd for the Island of _Ferdinando_, where
he hove down and clean'd the _Flying Dragon_; having careen'd, he put 11
_Dutchmen_ on board Captain _Spelt_, to make Amends for the Hands he had
forced from him, and sent him away, making him a Present of the Goods he
took from the _Portuguese_ Ship. When he sail'd himself, he ordered the
_Dutch_ to stay at _Ferdinando_ 24 Hours after his Departure;
threatning, if he did not comply, to sink his Ship; if he fell a second
Time into his Hands, and to put all the Company to the Sword. He then
stood for the Coast of _Brazil_, where he met a _Portuguese_ Man of War
of 70 Guns, which he came up with; the _Portuguese_ hal'd him, and he
answer'd, _from London_, bound for _Buenos Ayres_: The _Portuguese_
mann'd his Shrouds and chear'd him, when _Condent_ fired a Broadside and
a Volley of small Arms, which began a smart Engagement for the Space of
3 Glasses; but _Condent_ finding himself over-match'd, made the best of
his Way, and, being the better Sailor, got off.

Few Days after he took a Vessel of the same Nation, who gave an Account,
that he had killed above 40 Men in the _Guarda del Costa_, beside a
Number wounded; he kept along the Coast to the Southward, and took a
_French_ Ship of 18 Guns, laden with Wine and Brandy, bound for the
_South-Sea_, which he carried with him into the River of _Plate_. He
sent some of his Men ashore to kill some wild Cattle, but they were
taken by the Crew of a _Spanish_ Man of War; on their Examination before
the Captain, they said they were two _Guiney_ Ships, with Slaves
belonging to the _South-Sea_ Company, and on this Story were allowed to
return to their Boats: Here five of his forced Men ran away with his
Canoe, he plundered the _French_ Ship, cut her adrift, and she was
stranded. He proceeded along the _Brazil_ Coast, and hearing a Pyrate
Ship was lost upon it, and the Pyrates imprisoned, he used all the
_Portuguese_, who fell into his Hands, who were many, very barbarously,
cutting off their Ears and Noses; and as his Master was a Papist, when
they took a Priest, they made him say Mass at the Main-mast, and would
afterwards get on his Back and ride him about the Decks, or else load
and drive him like a Beast. He from this went to the _Guiney_ Coast, and
took Captain _Hill_ in the _Indian Queen_.

In _Luengo_ Bay he saw two Ships at Anchor, one a _Dutchman_ of 44 Guns,
the other an _English_ Ship, called the _Fame_, Captain _Bowen_,
Commander; they both cut and ran ashore, the _Fame_ was lost, but the
_Dutch_ Ship, the Pyrate, got off and took with him. When he was at Sea
again he discharged Captain _Hill_, and stood away for the
_East-Indies_. Near the Cape he took an _Ostend East-India_ Man, of
which Mr. _Nash_, a noted Merchant in _London_, was Supercargo. Soon
after he took a _Dutch East-India_ Man, discharged the _Ostender_, and
made for _Madagascar_; at the Isle of St. _Mary_, he met with some of
Captain _Halsey_'s Crew, whom he took on board with other Stragglers,
and shaped his Course for the _East-Indies_, and in the Way, at the
Island of _Johanna_, took, in Company of two other Pyrates he met at St.
_Mary_'s, the _Cassandra East-India_ Man, commanded by Captain _James
Macragh_; he continued his Course for the _East-Indies_, where he made a
very great Booty, and returning, touch'd at the Isle of _Mascarenas_,
where he met with a _Portuguese_ Ship of 70 Guns, with the Vice-Roy of
_Goa_, on board. This Ship he made Prize of, and hearing she had Money
on board, they would allow of no Ransom, but carried her to the Coast of
_Zanguebar_, where was a _Dutch_ Fortification, which they took and
plunder'd, razed the Fort, and carried off several Men who enter'd
voluntarily. From hence they stood for St. _Mary_'s, where they shared
their Booty, broke up their Company, and settled among the Natives: Here
a _Snow_ came from _Bristol_, which they obliged to carry a Petition to
the Governor of _Mascarenas_ for a Pardon, tho' they paid the Master
very generously. The Governor returned Answer, he would take them into
Protection if they would destroy their Ships, which they agreed to, and
accordingly sunk the _Flying Dragon_, &c. _Condent_ and some others went
to _Mascarenas_, where _Condent_ married the Governor's Sister-in-Law,
and stay'd some Time; but as I have been credibly inform'd, he is since
come to _France_, settled at St. _Maloes_, and drives a considerable
Trade as a Merchant.


                      A DESCRIPTION of _MAGADOXA_,
                     taken partly from the Journal
                   of Captain _Beavis_, and also from
                  an original Manuscript of a Molotto,
                   who was taken by the Natives, and
                   lived amongst them sixteen Years.

In the Year 1700, Capt. _William Beavis_, Commander of the Ship, called
the _Albemarle_, then in the Service of the _East-India_ Company, sail'd
from _England_, bound for _Surrat_, in the _East-Indies_, but after
having been some Months at Sea, having the Misfortune to meet with
contrary Masorns, he lost his Passage, so that he was forced on the
Coast of _Zanguebar_, in the higher _Ethiopia_, or the Continent of
_Africk_, where he endeavoured to find out some Place of Safety, that
the Ship might ride secure, and where he might meet with some
Necessaries for refreshing his Company, while he waited for the Change
of Winds, which he could not expect in less than three or four Months.

They came in with the Land, and cast Anchor on the ninth of _November_,
the Year before-mentioned; the Tenth it blew hard, but on the Eleventh
the Weather being pretty fair, the Captain sent the Yawl on Shore, in
two different Places, at considerable Distance from each other, they
found the Land every where sandy, and all over green with Shrubs, but
saw no Houses, nor could they discover the least Track of any human
Creature; however, they saw Deer, but could not come near enough to have
a Shot at them; they also found the Dung of Wolves, Hares, and some
other Animals, but saw none; and near the Water-side they found the
Shells of a great Number of Craw-Fish, but met with none alive;
wherefore, they guessed that they were left here by some Creatures, who
fished them up and usually fed upon them.

Finding this Place altogether inhospitable, they weigh'd Anchor and
sail'd along the Shore, till the 17th of the same Month, when the
Captain looking thro' his Spying-glass, saw three or four Men walking
along the Sea-Side, and sometimes sitting down, but could not discern
any House, Fire, or Smoak, but when they had sail'd about a League
farther, they perceived an Inlet or Bay, where the Captain fancied there
might be a River; he could also perceive several tall Trees, which were
the first they had seen since they came upon the Coast, which made the
Captain conjecture, that there must be some Inhabitants.

Upon this, they came to an Anchor, and manning out the Boat, the Captain
sent Mr. _Baldwin_ the third Mate in her, to go into the Bay, in order
to discover whether there was any River which discharged itself into it;
when they were in with the Shore, they perceived about fifty or sixty
People standing upon a Bank near the Water-side, and one separating
himself from the Rest, approached nearer to them, and held up a white
Piece of Linnen at the End of a Stick, and waved it at them, which they
understood to be a Flag of Friendship, and which the Boat answered by
the like Signal; then the Person on Shore beckon'd to them with his
Hand, which they took to be an Invitation to come on Shore, and
accordingly they ventured; there were two of the Boat's Men who spoke a
little _Portuguese_, who saluted this Man in that Language; as soon as
they came near him, his Gesture appeared very civil, but they could not
understand a Syllable of what he said in Answer, but by his Signs, they
fancied he invited them to come to their Huts, in order to eat and
drink.

However, they did not think fit to stay longer at this Time, but
returned on Board, to give the Captain an Account of what had pass'd,
and to let him know, that they could discover no River in the Bay; they
described the People to be pretty tall and well made, their Colour jet
black, their Heads and Beards close shaved, wearing upon their Heads
Turbants made of a Kind of Linnen, and a Sort of Sash made of Dungeree
Linnen about their Wastes, the Rest of their Bodies being quite naked;
whereupon, consulting with a Molotto, one of the Ship's Company, who
understood the _Turkish_ and _Arabian_ Languages, what he thought the
Language of these People might be, he judg'd it to be a Kind of
corrupted _Arabick_, because their Dress was not unlike that of the
_Arabians_ of the Desert, and that it was not unlikely, but that they
might be some Way descended from them; wherefore, the Captain resolved
to mann the Boat again, and to send the Molotto ashore with them, to try
if he could so far understand their Language, as to learn from them,
where there was fresh Water, or any other Refreshments to be had; and
also to enquire for some Port or Bay, where the Ship might be with
Safety till the breaking up of those Easterly Winds.

The Wind blew so fresh all that Day, which was the 19th, that they could
not send the Boat on Shore. At Night they watched to see if they could
discover any Appearance of Fire any where upon Land, but they could
discern nothing like it; wherefore, it seemed strange to them, that in a
Country inhabited, there should be neither Smoak by Day, nor Fire by
Night, which made them suppose, the Huts of the Natives were far up the
Country.

However, the next Day the Boat was sent on Shore with the Molotto
Interpreter, and Mr. _Courser_ the fourth Mate; and for Fear of any
Surprize, the Captain ordered them to carry Arms in the Boat. When they
approach'd near the Shore, several of the Natives made towards the
Waterside, but seeing the Boat's Men take their Arms in their Hands at
their Landing, they fled affrighted up the Country, nor would they ever
come near them after; the Men went a little Way up the Land and met with
some Huts, which were covered with the Shells of Turtles, which
Creatures it is supposed the Natives catch in their proper Season for
Food, and then making a Covering of their Shells for their Houses; they
also saw several Cows, at some Distance, which are very swift at
running, and not larger than our Deer; they saw some other Animals, but
took none, and so returned on Board without gaining any Intelligence.

The Mistake here was, that they did not lye off with their Boat, and
make a Signal as they did at first, which would have disposed the
Natives to have staid for them, as they did before, but going ashore
abruptly with Arms in their Hands, frighten'd the Natives, as if they
had come to kill them; wherefore, there was no Expectation of making any
Discovery here, which induced the Captain to weigh Anchor, and steer a
little farther Westward.

The next Morning, which was the twenty second, they came to an Anchor,
and sent their Boat on Shore again, with Mr. _Baldwin_ the third Mate,
and the Gunner; there being some high Hills not far from the Place where
they landed, the Mate and Gunner resolved to walk to the Top of one of
the highest of those Hills, in order to take a View of the Country
beneath. About four in the Afternoon they returned again to the Ship,
bringing Word, that there was a pleasant Valley on the other Side, about
five Miles in Length, and near as far in Breadth, but that they could
see no Houses or other Signs of Inhabitants, but that the Valley seemed
to abound with Deer, and several other Creatures; they brought on Board
three Antilopes, and two large Guiney Hens, which they shot, and saw
great Numbers of both these Creatures about the Bushes on the Sides of
those Hills; the Antilopes were small, but extreamly beautiful, their
Bodies no bigger than that of a Hare, but their Legs much longer, their
Colour was a Mixture of black and white, very smooth, and very bright,
with Horns about three Inches long.

They weigh'd and crept along ashore to the Westward, and next Day, which
was the Twenty third, the Captain with his Spying-glass saw seven or
eight Men near the Shore; wherefore, he sent the Boat to endeavour to
speak with them. As soon as they saw the Boat approach them, they went
off; the Men however went on Shore, and at some Distance saw two Camels
and two Asses loaden, pass along with Men attending them; they did what
they could to speak with these too, but when they perceived the Boat's
Men to make towards them, they drove so fast there was no coming near
them.

The next Morning the Weather being clearer than ordinary, the Captain
looking thro' his Glass, fancied he saw several tall Spires to the
Westward; he weigh'd Anchor, and stood away for them; by four in the
Afternoon, he plainly perceived a large Town, and by six came to an
Anchor right over against it; however, he did not send the Boat on Shore
that Night, but next Morning he ordered Mr. _Baldwin_ the third Mate,
Mr. _Sale_ the Purser, with the Molotto before-mentioned, who spoke the
_Turkish_ and _Arabian_ Languages, to take the Yawl with four Hands, and
to carry with them a white Flag, that they might appear to come in a
friendly and peaceable Manner, charging them at the same Time to say or
do nothing which might appear harsh or offensive. The Boat was no sooner
in with the Shore, but the Natives flock'd as it were to meet them, and
appeared very courteous: The Molotto spoke to them in _Arabian_ Tongue,
giving them to understand, that they were driven upon their Coasts by
the Misfortune of having lost their Voyage, that they were in Want of
Water, and begg'd they would shew them where they might be supplied, and
that if they would think fit to furnish them with fresh Provision they
would pay them in Money, or any Goods or Curiosities of _Europe_.

It happened the Language they spoke was a Kind of _Arabick_, so that the
Molotto could discourse with them perfectly well; they answered him,
that the King was absent from the City, and that they could do nothing
till his Return, but that he would be there as that Night, for they had
sent him Word of the coming of a Ship, as soon as it appeared in Sight.
That however, they might assure themselves, that all they requested
should be granted, and shewed them where there were several fine Springs
of Water: These Springs being a pretty Way from the Water-side, and the
Ground near them craggy and uneven; the Molotto told them it would be
difficult to rowl their Casks so long a Way, and over such bad Ground,
and ask'd them if there were not any Spring nearer the Sea. They
answered them no, but that the King would give them Oxen to draw their
Casks to the Boat; and so they returned on Board with a Present from the
King's Son of a Sarne of mash'd Dates, a matted Jar of Sweet-Meats, and
four Sheep.

Betimes the next Morning, being the 26th, the Captain sent the Yawl on
Shore again with the same Officers, to know if the King was come, and to
beg Leave to bring on Board some fresh Water, ordering them to make a
Signal for the Long-Boat to be sent on Shore, in Case they obtained the
Permission to water; the Yawl had not been long gone before the
appointed Signal was made, and the Long-Boat was accordingly sent
immediately; after which, the Captain perceived the Yawl was returning
back again to the Ship: She came with four Hands in her to advise the
Captain, that the Long-Boat would immediately return with a Cow as a
Present to him, and to put him in Mind, that it would be proper to send
something back for a Present to the _Shubander_, (the Name by which they
call the King's Son) with whom they, _viz._ the third Mate Mr.
_Baldwin_, the Gunner, and the Molotto Interpreter, who served in the
Ship as a Quartier, were gone to dine.

The Captain was surprized at their Indiscretion, and the more because he
had ordered them, to be upon their Guard for Fear of Treachery, having
furnished them with Arms for that Purpose, and charged them not to stir
far from their Boat; however, there was no Remedy now, so that he sent
the Yawl back again with a Present of a small Looking-glass (a great
Curiosity there) for the Prince, ordering one Man to carry it, and to
tell the Mate, Gunner, and Molotto to come off as soon as they could,
the rest to lye a little off with the Yawl, their Arms ready, but out of
Sight.

The Captain observing the Yawl with his Glass, perceived the Men
contrary to his Orders were gone on Shore, and looking again a little
after, saw the Boat without a Mast, or so much as one Hand in her,
drag'd towards the Town quite on Shore, and in a little Time after she
was hawl'd out of Sight.

This Rashness of his Men gave him a great Deal of Uneasiness, he
apprehended some fatal Consequence from it, (and indeed he had Reason)
for he knew the Natives of some Part of the Coast were Cannibals;
therefore, for Fear of venturing too much at once, he resolved not to
trust the Long-Boat on Shore, till he had some Tideings from the Yawl.

All that Day he pass'd with the utmost Uneasiness, keeping a Man
continually on the Watch, looking towards the Shore with a Spying-glass,
to try if any Thing could be discovered of his Men on the Shore, but all
to no Purpose; for nothing could be discerned either of them or the Boat
the whole Day. That Night was spent in many doubtful Reflections, and
Tears for the Condition of those who were on Shore. Next Morning the
Captain resolved to send the Long-Boat towards the Land, with Mr. _Nyn_
his first Mate, and some other of his Officers in her, ordering them to
shew a white Flag, as soon as they should discover any People to come
near them; but not to venture to go ashore, but to talk and make Signs
to the Natives out of the Boat, and to try to discover the Reason of our
Mens being detained; and in Case they found they kept them Prisoners, or
intended them for Slaves, to try by Means of the Molotto Interpreter to
treat with them for their Ransom.

Mr. _Nyn_ obey'd his Orders punctually, and when he came near the Land
he lay by, with a white Flag display'd at the End of a Mast, at which
Time he observed a great Body of People coming from the Town towards the
Sea-Side; the Captain could also discern them from the Ship with his
Spying-glass, and judg'd them to be betwixt four and five Thousand, but
instead of coming to parley, they marched in a Body behind a Bank, which
stood opposite the Boat, where they lay in a Kind of Ambuscade, without
returning any Signal, or shewing any Inclination to speak with the Boat.

This look'd plainly, as if they intended to surprize the Men, in Case
they should venture to land; wherefore Mr. _Nyn_ resolved to return on
Board, and plying along Shore, in order to find the Passage thro' the
Ridge of Rocks of Coral, which runs along ashore, the Natives let fly a
Shower of Arrows at the Boat, which however did no Harm, because they
fell short; upon which Mr. _Nyn_ commanded his Men to fire their Arms
towards the Banks, in order to frighten them, for being so intrench'd,
he knew he could do them no Harm; after which he returned on Board.

The Captain now began to despair of ever seeing his Men more; the best
he could think which could befal them, was, to be made Slaves, for still
he did not apprehend that they had met with so melancholy and cruel a
Fate, as their Confidence in the Natives had really brought upon them;
he therefore resolved to make one Attempt more, in order to learn some
News of what had befallen them: In order to which, he thought of a
Stratagem, by which he should run no Hazard of losing any more of his
Men, and by which it seemed probable he must hear of them if they were
alive. He writ a Letter, which Letter he caused to be fix'd to the Top
of a long Pole, which he ordered to be carried on Shore in the Silence
of the Night; the Men were to fix the Pole in the Ground, and to make it
the more conspicuous, there was a Flag also fastened to the Pole.

He did not doubt, but that if any of his Men had the Liberty of walking
about, they would come for the Letter which they must see, and if they
had not that Liberty, the Natives not being able to read it themselves,
would carry it to them.

In this Letter he advised Mr. _Baldwin_, and Mr. _Sale_, the third Mate
and Purser, to treat about their own Ransom themselves, and that of the
five Men with them (including the Molotto) and since there was no other
Way of procuring their Liberty, he would comply with the Terms, let them
be what they would; he directed them to fix their Answer upon the same
Pole, and least they should want Pen and Ink, he inclosed a Pencil, and
also a Sheet of Paper. And in Hopes an Answer should be left, he
commanded the Pole to be fix'd just at the Waters Edge, where there was
no Bank near, that it might be taken off without the Danger of an
Ambuscade.

This was the best Expedient he could think of, for relieving his unhappy
Countrymen, who now, alas! were past all Relief. Accordingly the Boat
was sent with the said Letter, and two of the Men went on Shore and
fixed it, and having returned into the Boat, the Boat put off, and came
to an Anchor at some Distance from the Shore, in order to observe what
should become of the Letter; they waited till Noon to no Purpose, then
taking up their Anchor, in order to come on Board for some Refreshment,
they were but a little while under Sail, when they saw a Man come and
carry off the Pole; a little while after which, as they ply'd along the
Shore, and were opposite to the Bank before described, they were saluted
with a Volley of Musquet-Shot, one Ball falling into the Boat, and
several others come very near it; wherefore, they made all the Sail they
could to give the Captain an Account of what had pass'd.

The Fire Arms they made use of were these they found in the Boat, where
they also met with six Cartouch Boxes full of Charges, and their making
use of them in this Manner, convinced the Captain that they had no Mind
to come to any Parley with them, or to listen to any Terms about the
Release of their unhappy Ship Mates; however they were continually upon
the Watch, looking out with wishing Eyes, in Expectation of seeing the
appointed Signal made for the Answer of the Letter; long they expected
to no Purpose, which made the Captain think something very fatal had
happened to them, and that he should never see them more; but in the
midst of his Despair, a Thought came into his Head, which administred to
him a little Comfort, he fancied that perhaps they might be carried up
the Country, to the Place where the King at that Time was gone, and that
the Natives might send the Letter after them, which might be the Reason
there was no Answer yet left. Upon this little Glimmering of Hope, he
resolved to wait some Days longer, for he was willing to lay Hold of any
Hope, rather than bear the Thoughts of going away without them.

Thus Day after Day they waited in Expectation of some Answer, sending
the Boat to lye off near the Shore, to be ready in Case any Signal
should be made.--One Day they perceived a great Number of People to come
out of the Town, and make towards the Shore, which gave them an
Expectation that the Delivery of their Friends was at Hand; they watched
their Motions with earnest Eyes, hoping every Minute to see a Flag of
Truce, instead of which, they observed them to march directly behind the
Bank, where they seem'd to place themselves in a Kind of Ambuscade.

Now there seem'd to be an End of all their Hopes, the Boat return'd on
Board, and made a Report to the Captain of what they saw, who calling a
Consultation of all his Officers to hear if any Thing could be offered
for the Relief of their Companions; it was proposed by one to send the
Boat on Shore, to burn some Junks which were hawl'd up about a
Musquet-Shot from the Water-side, but the Captain considered, that tho'
this might gratifie their Revenge, it would bring no Relief to their
poor captive Friends: On the contrary, the Natives might be provoked to
destroy them for it, if they had not done it already, besides as these
Junks lay not far from the Bank, their Men might be exposed to the
Arrows of the Natives (who now lay in continual Ambuscade) and so they
might run the Hazard of losing more Men without the least Advantage to
themselves, or unhappy Companions.

Wherefore, this Project was laid aside, and the Winds often blowing
hard, and the Captain not judging it safe to lye any longer in that open
Road, he weighed Anchor on the fourth of _December_, steering along
ashore, in Search of some Bay or Inlet, where they might ride shelter'd
from the Wind and Weather; and still with a View that if either their
Companions might have an Opportunity of making their Escape, or the
Natives should relent and think of letting them go for a Ransom, they
might be near enough to receive them. After about three or four Hours
gentle Sail he dropp'd an Anchor, the Town of _Magadoxa_ then bearing N
E b'E of them, they perceived it was all along a flat smooth Shore,
without any Bay or other Shelter, for Ships to ride; wherefore, the next
Day, which was the fifth of _December_, they stood off to Sea, and then
came to a Consultation, what Measures to take in their present
Condition; and having considered that they had met with no Place where
they could ride with any Safety, and if they should meet with a
convenient Bay much farther down the Coast, it would be of no Service to
their unhappy Companions, who would never hear of them; and besides they
could not venture to traffick with the Natives for Refreshments, for
Fear of Surprize and Treachery; and their Men beginning to grow weak and
distempered for want of fresh Provisions, they resolved to make for the
Island of _Joanna_, being forced to leave their Companions to
Providence, in great Trouble and Anxiety for their unhappy Fate.

We shall leave them to pursue their Voyage, which was happy enough,
bating this Accident, and relate what had pass'd on Shore, as we had it
from a Manuscript, written by the Molotto Interpreter, who was the only
Person who escaped, and return'd to _England_, after he had lived
sixteen Years amongst the Barbarians.

It has been already taken Notice that Mr. _Baldwin_ the third Mate, and
Mr. _Sale_ the Purser (unhappily for them) not observing the Cautions
the Captain gave them to be upon their Guard, were so indiscreet, to be
tempted to accept of an Invitation to dine with the King's Son; so that
having sent the Yawl on Board again, for a Present as has been related,
they with the Molotto Interpreter went towards the Town, accompanied by
several of the Natives, who made them the Invitation in the Name of the
King's Son. They were no sooner arrived at the first Gate of the City,
but they were surrounded by a great Multitude of People, and violently
dragg'd into a little Door under the Gateway, and shut up in a dark
Hole. When they had remained here about the Space of two Hours, they
heard a very great Noise without; soon after which, the Doors leading to
their Dungeon were all opened, and they were dragg'd out again; when
they were out, they found that what occasioned that great Noise, was the
Return of their Men, whom they had sent on Board for a Present for the
King's Son, who were seized in the same Manner they had been, and being
encompassed by such a Number of People, they lost them in a Minute; they
were also separated from one another, and the Molotto desiring to know
of them the Meaning of all this, and in what they had offended them,
they only answered him, that they must go before the _Accabo_, (the Name
by which they call the King, who had not been out of Town as they gave
out before) accordingly he was conducted with a sufficient Guard,
expecting there to meet his Companions again.

When he arrived at the King's House (which shall be hereafter described)
he was led thro' several Rooms to that where the King was present, whom
he found sitting upon the Ground, the Floor being matted; he was dress'd
in a long Pair of Drawers of blewish purple Silk, which reach'd down to
his Toes, having neither Shoes nor Stockings on, a large Mantle of the
same Silk, and a white Turbant on his Head; there were eight others who
sat about him, whose Dress was the same with his, as to Form and
Fashion, but their Drawers and Mantles were made of a blew and white
strip'd Dungeree Stuff, instead of Silk; these were his Councellors and
Favourites. The King spoke to him in a Kind of _Arabick_, asking of what
Country he was? he answered of _Canton_ in _China_. Then he ask'd him,
how he came to associate himself with those horrid white Men? The poor
Molotto began to tremble at this Question, but excus'd himself by
speaking in their Favour, highly extolling them for their Civility of
Behaviour, as well as Generosity, and praising them in all Things to the
King, telling him, he was sure the Captain would ransom them, if it was
his Pleasure to consent to it; to which he returned no Answer, but ask'd
what the Ship had in her, the Molotto gave him an Account of her Lading;
then he desired to know whether the rest of the Men would come on Shore,
he answered, he could not tell, but in Case they were suffered to return
again on Board, he was sure they would come on Shore, and that the
Captain himself designed to come and see the King, as soon as they
should return; but the King made no Offer of suffering that, but
commanded him to be carried back to Prison.

The Prison which they call _Haulaub_, is a square Stone-Building, about
twenty Foot high, and flat at Top, fronting one of their broadest
Streets; there are no Windows or Iron Bars, as we see in our Prisons,
but there are several little Holes about eight or nine Inches square,
quite thro' the Wall, thro' which, the Place within receives both Light
and Air. Here the poor Molotto was put, very anxious about the Fate of
his poor Companions, whom he had not seen since their being separated at
their first coming out of the Dungeon; wherefore, seeing an old Man
looking thro' one of the Holes before described, he enquired of him what
was become of them, who gave him this melancholy Account; that those who
came last out of the Boat, which were the four Sailors sent on Board the
Ship for the Present for the King's Son, were kill'd in the Streets by
the Multitude, and that making some Resistance, they were torn to
Pieces, every Man thinking himself happy that could procure a Piece of
their Flesh, shewing a Bit of about two Ounces, which he begg'd of one
who had got a great Piece, which many of them eat; that they were all
from their Childhood taught to have an Aversion to white Men, and that
these were the first that had been seen in the Memory of Man, that as to
the tall Man and the little Man which had been in the Dungeon with him
(which were Mr. _Baldwin_ and Mr. _Sale_, the Mate and Purser) they were
by the King's Order carried to the _Boderzau_ (a Place where Tygers and
other fierce Beasts are kept for the King's Pleasure) and delivered up
to be torn to Pieces by those Animals.

This was in Effect, the true Account of the most bloody Massacre that
was committed upon these unhappy Men; the Story of which, it may be
imagined, must throw the poor Molotto into the utmost Consternation and
Fear, as imagining himself to be near suffering some cruel Death;
sometimes he flattered himself that they would spare him, because of his
being a Molotto, but on the other Side, when he reflected on his having
given the white Men a good Character, he look'd upon himself to be a
dead Man, thinking that alone was sufficient to destroy him.

Betwixt these Doubts and Fears he pass'd the Night, in a Place all
covered with Nastiness, where there was not the least Conveniency for
easing Nature, and where, had his Mind been at rest, it would have been
hard for him to have slept. In the Morning a Man look'd thro' one of the
Holes, and with great Joy in his Countenance, told him, there were more
white Men coming on Shore; the Fellow did not relate it as good News to
him, but told it for the Pleasure they should have in destroying more of
them. The Molotto wish'd within himself, that he could have given Notice
of what had pass'd, and some Advice to beware of themselves, but it was
safest for him to keep his Wishes to himself; therefore he said nothing.
Some Hours after he was sent to go again before the King; now he thought
his Execution was at Hand, but when he was brought into the King's
Presence, they put a Letter into his Hand, commanding him to tell what
it meant, for that those who had come on Shore had stuck it upon a Pole,
and went off before they could be spoke to. He saw at one Cast of an
Eye, that it was from the Captain, who talk'd of Ransom, and a sudden
Thought came into his Head, that if he had explained it to the King,
they would make him some Way instrumental, in decoying more of the Men
on Shore, in order to murder them; and knowing his Companions to be past
all Ransom, he said he did not know the Ways of the white Men, and could
not understand what that meant. The King then ask'd him if he could
persuade the white Men, who were at that Time lying at an Anchor, in
their Boat some Distance from the Land, to come on Shore, he answered he
would endeavour to do it, if it was his Pleasure; upon which the King
whisper'd with some others, who were near him, but said no more of it,
as being unwilling to trust him. And the Truth on't is, he designed to
tell them what had pass'd, and if the Natives did not hold him fast, to
throw himself into the Sea, and venture to swim to them, not doubting,
but those in the Boat might with their Fire Arms, secure him from being
pursued, but they gave no Opportunity of making the Attempt.

The King then call'd for one of the Fire-Arms, which had been taken in
the Boat, and commanded him to shew them how they were to be used, which
he was forced to do; and they made use of them soon after, by firing at
the Boat as has been related. He was then carried back to Prison, and
talking with the Jaylor (whom in their Language they call _Kasboo_) he
ask'd him what he thought the King intended to do with him? The Jaylor
answered, he was sure he did not intend to have him kill'd, as the white
Men had been, because he had ordered him to give him Food; this News a
little revived his drooping Spirits, accordingly he brought him some
Plantanes and Bonanas, which was the first Nourishment he had taken
since he came on Shore; and having refreshed himself therewith, and with
an _Alabo_ of Water, that is, a Vessel not unlike a Pitcher, he begg'd
for something to clean the Place, the Jaylor brought him a Parcel of
green Sticks tied together, which they call a _Tosee_, and serves for
the Use of a Broom; with this and a Thing like a Shovel, he made a Shift
to sweeten the Place pretty well; when it was done, he observed an old
Man looking thro' one of the Holes at him, with whom he fell into
Discourse, and enquired of him whether the Ship was gone, the old Man
told him no, but that there was another Boat with white Men lying off
the Land, and that there were great Numbers of People from the Town
lying in Wait for their coming on Shore. He begg'd this old Man to get
him a few Palmatu Leaves to lay on the Floor under him, which the old
Man did, so that that Night he rested very comfortably to what he had
done before.

The next Morning he was again sent for before the King, who ask'd him,
if he could kill a _Coway_ with one of those Musquets? he answered he
could, and glad he was to be so employed, thinking by these Means he
might please the King, at least gain his Favour so far, as to induce him
to spare his Life. He was led out to the River-side, the King himself
being in Company, and one of the Musquets was put into his Hand, he took
the Ball and beat it into a great Length, and then divided it into small
Bits about the Size of Swan Shot, for he would not venture to shoot with
a single Ball, not knowing but his Life might depend upon the Success of
his Shoot, by these Means he kill'd one the first Shot. The King seemed
very well pleased, and made him charge the Piece again in the same
Manner, and taking it into his own Hands discharged it at another
_Coway_ which he also kill'd.

A _Coway_ is a fine beautiful Bird larger than a Swan, and not much
unlike it in Shape, the Body is as white as Milk, but the Tuft it wears
on its Head, as also its Tail, are adorned with Variety of Colours, the
Bill is a little crooked, and uneven, its Legs of a fine Yellow, but its
Form is best expressed by the Figure. They are in great Plenty always
living near the Water, hatching fourteen or fifteen young Ones at a
Time, and set four Times a Year; they are excellent to eat, nor do they
taste at all fishy.

After this, he was ordered back to his Prison, as he went along he ask'd
the Jaylor (with whom he was now grown more familiar) what he thought
the King intended to do with him. The _Kasboo_ or Jaylor told him, he
believed he intended to keep him there till the Ship (which they call a
_Schabew_) and the white Men were gone, and that then he would order him
to be releas'd from his Confinement, and employ him in some Service. The
Jaylor seem'd to talk to him, and use him in a much kinder Manner than
before; and when he arrived at the Prison, he brought him a _Patue_ (in
their Language a Dish) of boiled Rice with Oyl, which is look'd upon to
be very good Food; he left him two large _Alaboes_ or Pitchers of Water,
sufficient to drink and to clean his Kennel, after which, he took a
comfortable Nights Rest.

The poor Fellow now began to wish that the Ship was gone, since he had
no Prospect of making his Escape, and that their Departure would procure
him greater Liberty. Next Morning seeing the old Man who had furnish'd
him with the Palmatu Leaves, looking thro' one of the Holes at him, he
enquired of him, whether the Ship was still in Sight? He told him it
was, that there were still great Numbers of People lying behind the
Bank, having with them those Things which were taken in the Boats,
describing the Musquets, and great Numbers of Arrows, ready to shoot if
they should either Land, or come near enough with their Ship; he begg'd
of him to let him know what should happen, and particularly to inform
him when the Ship should go off: The old Man whose Name was _Morasab_,
seem'd obliging and kind, and promised him to do so, and that he would
return towards Night (which in their Language they call _Raham_.)

A little after the _Kasboo_ or Jaylor came in, bringing some Plantanes
and Bonana's to him for his Breakfast, and opened a Door which went into
a little back Yard, where there was a Spring of fine fresh Water,
bidding him draw what Water he pleased in his _Alaboes_, and clean his
Prison, leaving the Place open to him for that Purpose, there being no
Way for him to get out; towards Evening he came to him again, bringing
him some boyl'd Rice and Oyl, and then he shut up the Door before
described, and leaving him Water enough, left him for that Night.

_Morasab_ appeared at one of the Holes according to his Promise,
acquainting him, that the Ship remained still in the same Station, and
that the Boat had not been seen near the Land that Day. Next Morning
_Morasab_ came again, and with great Joy told him, the Ship was then
going off, being under Sail; a little after the _Kasboo_ or Jaylor came
in as usual, bringing some boyl'd Rice, and gave him the same Account of
the Ship.

Tho' he despaired now of ever getting off, yet he expected to be
enlarged from his Prison, and enjoy Liberty, the sweetest Thing to Man.
In the Evening _Morazab_ came again to let him know, that the Ship was
almost out of Sight, and that the King had sent a Party of Men to the
East, and another to the West, to watch the Coast, and lye in Wait for
the white Men, in Case they should Land any where else for Water or to
get Provisions. The next Day he came again and gave him Notice, that
Word had been brought to the King that the Ship had been seen again a
great Way off to the Westward, but that the Men had not come on Shore;
and the Day following he visited him again, with an Account, that News
was brought to the King that the Ship was gone off again, and sail'd out
of Sight.

Upon this, he expected to be immediately releas'd from his Confinement,
yet he was kept close to his Prison ten Days longer; the Reason as he
afterwards found, was, least the Ship might be hovering somewhere upon
the Coast, and having his Liberty he might find an Opportunity of
escaping to her; but when they seem'd pretty well assured that the Ship
was quite gone off, the King sent for him, and ask'd him, if he should
give him his Liberty, whether he would attempt to escape? He promised he
would not, and indeed any Attempt now would have been in Vain, for to
escape would have been a Thing impossible; upon which, the King
appointed him to attend upon his Person, and to live with his other
Servants, giving him Orders at the same Time not to go out of the City.

There was nothing at all uncomfortable in the Life he led here, for the
Service was easy, having very little to do; his chief Business was
carrying up the Pataes or Dishes for the King's Dinner, who eat upon the
Ground, the Floor being sometimes covered with a Mat instead of a Cloth,
and sometimes bare without any Thing; the Diet was generally boiled
Rice, with broiled Meat, sometimes Venison, sometimes wild Goat; as also
Fowl of all Sorts, which are smaller than those of _Europe_, but of an
excellent Taste; they have also several Fowl not known to us; their Beef
and Mutton are both excellent, but small; they also had Variety of Fish
which they dress, either by boiling or broiling, as for Sawce, the King
himself had none, except _Kajan_, Pepper, for they eat most of their
Things very hot, and boiled Rice is what serves them instead of Bread.

Thus he lived in Plenty, eating as much as he would of what was left,
when the King had done Dinner, so that few People as to Eating and
Drinking tasted so great a Variety as he did; the Diet of the common
Sort of People, consists generally of Plantanes, Bonana's, boiled Rice
(which they call _Pasida_) and Oil, and a Dish they call _Kaja_, which
is Plantanes and Rice boiled together, sometimes indeed they have
Venison and wild Goat, which they kill themselves, but whatever it is,
they eat it out of the Crock it is boiled in, for none but those of
great Condition have the Use of _Pataes_ or Dishes; if it be broiled,
whether it be Fish or Flesh, they eat it off the Coals, and to avoid
burning their Fingers, they take a Bit of green Stick which they break
half through, and so bending it together, it serves the Use of a Pair of
Tongues as well as a Fork, in turning the Meat upon the Coals as well as
taking it off when it is ready. As for Knives and Forks the King himself
is not acquainted with the Use of them; so that he pulls his Meat to
Pieces with his Fingers, which is generally so well done that it
requires no great Labour.

It was about two Months before he ventured to stir abroad beyond the
Palace; but one Day one of the Servants who had Business about the City,
ask'd him to go along with him, and in Discourse told him, the King
would not be displeas'd, if he should go out often; upon this
Encouragement he used to walk about the City almost every Day, chusing
the Time when the King went to sleep, which was constantly his Practice
every Afternoon. He took this Liberty three or four Months together,
sometimes being absent several Hours without receiving the least
Reprimand; he made an Acquaintance with several in the City, and had
Leisure to satisfie his Curiosity, in observing every Thing that
appeared new and strange, to one who had lived so long amongst the
_Europeans_.

The City of _Magadoxa_ lies (as has been observ'd) in the Latitude of
one Degree and fifty one Minutes: It is built betwixt two Hills or
rather on the Sides of two Hills, the greatest Part of it standing on
the Declivity of that Hill next the Sea, so that there is scarce any of
it to be seen by any Ship in the Road, or that passes by, which indeed
are but few; for scarce any ever touch there, except driven by 'Stress
of Weather, as was the Case of the _Albemarle_. They have no Vessels of
their own, except a few employ'd in Fishing, which they call Juncks, and
not above ten or twelve of those; and tho' some of them are large enough
to carry thirteen or fourteen Ton, they never venture far from the Land.

The City contains betwixt three and four thousand Houses, some built of
rough Stone, others of Marble, of which they have many Quaries,
extreamly fine, and of various Colours, but they want the Art of
polishing it; but the most esteemed and most expensive Houses, are those
of rough Stone covered over with a Kind of Plaister, which is peculiar
to this Country; after it is laid on, it is not above three Days in
drying, and grows as hard and durable as the Stone itself; but the
greatest Curiosity of it is, that they can make it of what Colour they
please; and as the Houses of all Persons of Condition are covered with
it, it has a mighty pretty Effect to the Eye, for some have their Houses
white, others red, some yellow, and some blue, that of the King was
green, while the Inside is floor'd with the same Plaister, the Rooms all
differing in Colour from each other, which Variety makes the City appear
very beautiful, tho' the Streets are very narrow and very nasty.

Notwithstanding the Houses look so bright without Side, their Furniture
within consists of very little more than Cobwebs, for they have neither
Tables, Chairs, nor Glasses, they have indeed Matts which serve them
instead of Table-Cloths by Day, and Beds by Night, upon which they lie
without either Pillow or Bolster, with a Covering of Mokaz or thick
Dungeree over them, which is so call'd from a Tree of that Name, of the
Bark of which it is made, which being beaten, is drawn into long
Threads, and wove or rather work'd with fine Needles made of Wood,
either thick or thin, according to which it is intended; and to such a
Perfection are they arrived in this Sort of Manufacture, that they can
make it as smooth, and as soft, as a Piece of _English_ Broad-Cloth, and
much stronger.

We should have observed that they have no such Things as Glass-Windows
to their Houses, however there are either large round or square
Vacancies in every Room to receive both Air and Light; these Sort of
Windows are covered generally all Day with Shutters of thick Plank, in
which many Holes are bored, in order to keep out the Heat of the Sun. As
for Chimneys they have no such Thing: In all great Houses there is a
Room appropriated for the Dressing the Victuals, where the Fire is made
in a Corner upon the Ground, and those that are employ'd in that Service
must be well smoaked. The common People frequently make their Fires
without Doors, for Rice and Fish they never eat without some Sort of
Dressing, but Flesh, to save Trouble and Fire, they frequently eat raw.

The King maintains nothing which has the State or Air of a Court, having
no Guards about his Person, so that he frequently walks abroad in the
Streets in the Dress before described, without either Shoes or
Stockings: All those that meet him pass him by, and go on upon their
Business without shewing him any external Mark of Respect; nay so little
a Notion have they of Ceremony, that it is common for Persons of both
Sexes to ease Nature in the Streets, perhaps when the King is passing
by, and yet he is as well obey'd as any Prince in the World.

The Nobility walk about in as careless a Manner as the King, and are
known by their Turbants; the better Sort of the common People wear Caps
of various Colours, the Rest go intirely naked.

The Queen also walks about the Streets without either Guards or
Attendants, and would pass as unregarded as the King, were it not that
the Gaiety of her Dress must draw the Eyes of the Spectators; she
commonly wears a Garment of either purple or green Silk, which being
tied about her Waste reaches down to her Heels, with Variety of white,
red, and green Feathers artfully disposed in her Hair, however she is
bare-footed like the Rest, whilst all the poorer Sort of the Sex go
quite naked, without thinking they carry any Thing about them they ought
to be ashamed of.

The Wives of the Men of Condition indeed all wear Clothes, and are
dress'd in the same Fashion with the Queen, tho' not all so gay or so
rich; but whatever their Habits may be, they take Care always to shew
their naked Breasts, which hang down to their Bellies, if they have had
any Children; and which we suppose is look'd upon as a Beauty, by their
taking Care to expose them to View; they also paint the Nipples red,
which is the only Art they use in setting off their Persons; they bring
their Children into the World with little or no Pain, and without an
Hour's Confinement from the common Occupations of Life.

The only Occasion when the King appears with any Thing that looks like
Pomp or Magnificence is, when he rides abroad to take the Air, then he
is mounted upon one of his Elephants, with his Favourites and Companions
about him; they have a Way of fixing upon the Back of the Elephant, a
Frame of Boards about eight or ten Foot Square, on which, he, with such
as he carries with him to bear him Company, sit as commodiously as if in
a Room, whilst two of his Servants on Foot conduct the Beast; yet even
here, tho' he goes thro' any Crowd of People, no Man stops to do him
Homage, or to pay him any Sort of Obedience, nor does he seem to expect
it, having no Notion, that the Subjects are to be kept in Awe by the
Shew of Grandeur which surrounds their Prince: A Mark of good Sense,
beyond what is to be met with in the Courts of _European_ Princes.

His Way of maintaining an inward Respect in the Hearts of the People
which they have Sense enough to know, is preferable to that External
which consist only in Shew and Appearance, and sometimes conceals
Contempt and Hatred at Bottom, is by doing Justice in his Person,
according to the best of his Judgment and Capacity; he is himself both
King and Judge, and decides all Disputes betwixt Man and Man (which
indeed are very few) by a personal Hearing of the Cause of Complaint. He
is assisted by seven or eight Persons, who always sit about him for that
Purpose, and may be called his Councellors; nor was it ever so much as
suspected that any of these, either for Bribe, or Reward, or Promise,
endeavoured to influence the King in his Judgment.

It rarely happens that any Persons is condemn'd to die; for as every
Thing they feed on, except Rice, Plantanes, Oil, _&c._ is acquired by
hunting and fishing, there are few Occasions for Theft amongst them;
however, when any Person has merited that Punishment, the common Way of
executing is, by throwing the Criminal, into the Den (which they call
_Bodyzaw_) amongst the wild Beasts, such as Tygers, Leopards, and
Crocadiles which are kept hungry before-hand for that Purpose.

There are many other Creatures kept in that _Bodizaw_ or Den which are
peculiar to this Country, such as the _Augazet_, which is the largest of
all their Beasts, except the Elephant; it is of a white or rather
yellowish Colour, with Streaks of Black running like Veins all over it,
and also black Spots, the Face is not unlike that of a Cat, it has long
sharp Claws; when it is wild, it is extreamly fierce, but may be
rendered as gentle and tractable as a Household Dog.

A _Bozee_ is an amphibious Creature, which always lives by the Sides of
Rivers, and feeds principally upon Fish; it has a long Bill, and in all
Respects the Shape and Form of a Bird, but wants Wings to fly, and
instead of Feathers, is covered all over with a hard Scale resembling
the Bark of a Tree, and so tough that an Arrow will not enter it; their
Legs are very thick and scaled in the same Manner with their Bodies,
having sharp Claws to their Feet; the Natives are more afraid of this
Creature than of any other in the whole Country, especially, if they are
obliged to travel any where by Night, near the Sides of Rivers, for they
say it is so fierce and voracious, that it will seize either Man or
Beast.

The _Massau_ is another amphibious Creature, very large, whose Body is
scaly like that of the _Bozee_, but it is of a different Colour, being
reddish; the Bill also differs from that of the _Bozee_, for it is short
and shaped like that of a Pidgeon; It is a timorous Creature, that upon
hearing the least Noise immediately rushes for the Water; its Food is
chiefly Weeds.

A _Sachew_ is a Beast about the Size of a large Lion, of a dark brown
Colour, with Shades of black all over the Body, and a Scale down his
Back as hard as Horn, the Eyes are extreamly fierce, and in all Respects
a terrible Creature to look at, but yet a Child would frighten it.--At
the Sight of any human Creature it flies with great Swiftness to the
Woods.

One of the King's Diversions is, to go to this _Bodizaw_ or Den of wild
Beasts to see them play; they are perfectly under the Command of their
Keepers, and are taught to play Tricks like Dogs; nay, it is almost his
only Diversion, unless sleeping half the Day can be called a Diversion.
As for riding out upon his Elephants, as we took Notice before, he does
it so seldom, it can scarce be reckon'd amongst his Pleasures.

Ease, Plenty, and the Heat of the Climate have render'd the People in
general inclined to be slothful, they have no Trade with the
Neighbouring Nations, nor do they desire to have any; it is true, they
have a little Sort of Traffick amongst themselves, as those that hunt
and shoot Goats, Venison, _&c._ give them often in Exchange for Dungeree
Stuffs; they have also Gold and Silver amongst themselves, but very
base;--they don't seem inclined to Cruelty, unless against white Men,
whom they are taught to hate, tho' they scarce ever see any; but there
is a Kind of historical Tradition amongst them (for they have no Books)
that their Country was once invaded by white Men, who committed many
Cruelties upon them, and indeed it is likely that the _Portuguese_ might
formerly have landed amongst them, while they were making their _India_
Discoveries, and perhaps might have treated them like Slaves, from
whence comes this Tradition, and which is the Case of their inbred
Hatred to white Men to this Day.

Thus the Molotto had Leisure to divert himself with observing the
Customs and Manners of these strange People, who have no Commerce or
Communication with the Rest of the World. One Day as he was walking in
the City, he was extreamly surpriz'd and terrified at the Sight of a
Bird of a monstruous Size, which stalk'd close by him in the Street: It
was what they call a _Pyone_, but he had never seen one of them before,
so that tho' it is tame and inoffensive, it is no Wonder he should be
frighten'd at it.

A _Pyone_, as to Shape, differs from all Birds amongst us; their Colour
is a whitish brown, and in the Pinion of each Wing they have five black,
and five scarlet Feathers, very broad, and above a Foot long; their Legs
are of a bright red, something small for so large a Body, and above
three Foot in Length; their Necks are also extreamly long, so that from
the Foot to the Top of their Heads they are generally ten Foot in
Heighth; they breed in the Mountains, never sit on more than two Eggs at
a Time, which always produce a Male and Female: The People catch them
when they are young, and let them loose in the Streets, taking Pleasure
in the Sight of them, for they do no Mischief, and feed on any Thing
they can pick up.

He was so encouraged by this Indulgence which was shew'd him, that he
thought he might go where he pleased, and that the Restriction which was
laid upon him, was as good as taken off; wherefore, he was tempted by
his Curiosity one Day to walk out of the City, and was seen by a great
many People. The Day following the _Accabo_ or King, with a stern
Countenance, ask'd him if he had been out of the City? He was so
terrified at his Looks, knowing also, that he had been commanded not to
take that Liberty, that he was not able to answer: The King's Son who
was present, smilingly ask'd him, why he did not speak? This recovered
him a little from his Astonishment, so that he had the Courage to own he
had; then the King with a more pleasing Aspect, desired to know of him,
whether he had been to see his _Moorzacks_, or Tombs, he answered no;
tho' he had a great Desire of seeing them, because he had heard much
Talk of them. So the Thing pass'd over without any farther Reprimand for
this Time.

The next Day in the Afternoon, the King rid out on an Elephant in the
Manner before described, ordering the Molotto to attend him, and went to
visit the _Moorzacks_, or Monuments of his Ancestors, which are situated
about three or four Miles from the City: The Magnificence and Beauty of
these Tombs, are almost incredible, considering that it is in a Country
of _Barbarians_ that they are made; the Molotto was greatly surprized at
their extraordinary Grandeur; the King took Notice of his Astonishment,
and was not displeased at it, and enquiring of him how he liked them,
the Molotto answered, he had never seen any Thing equal to them, in all
his Life, and that he believed Strangers would travel from all Parts of
the World to see them, did they but know such Things were there. The
King then enquired of him concerning the Tombs of the white Men, and
ask'd several Questions about the Ceremonies used in Funerals in all the
Countries he had been in; the Molotto gave him the best Account he
could, still extolling the Beauty of these Monuments above those of all
the World. The King then enquired of him whether he knew how Gunpowder
was made, he answered no; that it was made by the white Men, and that he
was but little acquainted with their Ways. He answer'd in this Manner,
knowing that if he should speak with Respect of white Men, it might do
him some Prejudice, because of the Aversion he found they had towards
them. Upon the whole, the King appeared pleased with the Conversation of
this Day, and the Molotto fancied he should grow into Favour.

But two or three Days after, an Accident happened which put him again
into a Fright, going out to walk as usual, he ventured as far as the
_Moorzacks_, or Tombs, for he took a singular Pleasure in the Sight of
them. It happened in the mean Time that they wanted him, he was not to
be found in the King's House, or about the City; upon which, there were
several Persons sent in Search of him different Ways, one of them found
him among the _Moorzacks_, or Tombs, and brought him home, he was
dismally frightened, when he understood the King's Displeasure;
wherefore, as soon as he came into his Presence, he fell down upon his
Face, as is practiced by those with whom he is displeased. The King
ask'd him in an angry Tone where he had been? he answered at the
_Moorzacks_, or Tombs; then the King enquired of those that had been
sent in Search of him, whether it was true, they assured him they had
found him there; upon hearing of which, he seemed to be immediately
pacified, and said to him (_Korah_) which signifies properly to rise,
but is never said, except when he forgives. Then the King ask'd him, if
he would not attempt to run away, provided he should appoint him to live
constantly among the Guards, who were maintained for watching those
Monuments? he answered no; and that he should be pleased to pass the
Remainder of his Days in so delightful a Place, without ever having a
Wish for seeing his own Country again.

For this Time he was dismiss'd, but next Day being call'd up before the
King, he was told that he must go to the _Moorzacks_, or Tombs, there to
wait and do Duty as one of the Guards; there was a _Bamzau_ or Priest
sent along with him, who was to instruct him in his Duty there. On the
Way as he went, the _Bamzau_ or Priest told him, that he must live
constantly among the Monuments, and that he would have Meat, Drink, and
Lodging provided for him without any Trouble, that he must not take the
Liberty of coming to the City, or going beyond the Bounds prescribed,
which the Rest of the Guards whom they call _Passaus_ would shew him;
that he must be obliged to watch every second Night, to take Care that
the Lamps which burnt in the Tombs were supplied with Oil, and never
went out, and to keep the Tombs from any Filth or Nastiness.

When they arrived at the Place, the _Bamzau_ or Priest commanded all the
_Passaus_ or Guards to be called together, acquainting them that the
King had sent this Molotto amongst them to do the same Duty, and ordered
one whom he called out from amongst the Rest, to return to the King with
him, it being the King's Pleasure that the Molotto should supply his
Place. This was readily obeyed, and they departed together.

The _Passaus_ or Guards received him civilly enough, they immediately
began Acquaintance with him, explaining to him all the Particulars of
their Duty, and shewed him the Bounds within which he was to confine
himself; telling him if he pass'd those Limits, they must be obliged to
kill him. This Order seemed a little too severe, but he fancied it was
only said to terrify him, least he should take it into his Head to
attempt an Escape; he flattered himself so for two Reasons, First,
because of the Indulgence which had been shewn him when he ventured to
exceed his Orders in going out of the City; and secondly he took Notice
that the _Bamzau_ or Priest spoke to the _Passaus_ or Guards apart,
which he fancied was instructing them to keep him in Ignorance as to the
Truth of their Orders; they brought some boiled Rice and Oil cold, and
told him he must watch that Night, because it was the Turn of the Person
in whose Place he was come; in order to which, they brought him a
Watch-Coat made of Hair, which they work very curiously with Needles, so
that the whole Coat is of one entire Piece without a Seam; it hangs from
the Shoulders down to the Ground, but has no Sleeves, so that it is more
like a Cloak than a Coat.

The Sun being set, which is the Time they enter upon the Watch, every
two Men began to fix their _Pohalick_, over against the Door of the
_Moorzack_ they were to watch; but to understand this Matter, it will be
necessary to explain what a _Pohalick_ is,--A _Pohalick_ is a Kind of a
Tent, contrived to shelter them from the Inclemencies of the Weather,
for the Nights are sometimes very cold there, especially if it rains;
wherefore, they take four Poles of about eight Foot long, which, instead
of fixing in the Ground, are plac'd in four Stone-Sockets, placed on
Purpose, opposite to each _Moorzack_, for that Use, with Cross-Poles
reaching from one to the other; but instead of Canvass they hang over it
a Covering of Palmatu Leaves sewen together; the two oldest Standers
have their Post opposite to the King's _Moorzack_, the Rest are posted
according to their Seniority, for they are exact Observers of the Rules
of Precedence; the youngest also in each Pohalick, fetches Wood for
Fire, which is also absolutely necessary, as well to keep off the
Musketoos which would be, otherwise, very troublesome, as to correct the
Damps. As soon as the Sun rises, he also takes down the Pohalick, sweeps
up the Ashes very clean, which remain of the Fire, and carries them
away, that the Place may appear perfectly neat. It is his Duty also to
go to the _Bankoos_ (so they call the Steward of the _Moorzacks_) for
the Provision of the Day, which he is afterwards to dress both for
himself and his Comrade.

This Part of the Duty was not disagreeable to the Molotto, for having no
Books to read, he would have grown melancholly for Want of something to
divert his Time, had he been entirely idle; their Allowance of Provision
was sufficient, and very good in its Kind. On _Sundays_ and _Tuesdays_
it was Flesh, either Beef, Mutton, or Goat, and Rice for Bread. On
_Wednesdays_, Kaja (we have already told what that is) _Mondays_ and
_Fridays_, Fish and Plantanes. _Thursdays_ and _Saturdays_ Plantanes,
Rice, and Oil. Their Fish was excellent in its Kind, but they usually
dress'd it without taking out the Guts, and which they eat with it
instead of Sauce, but the Molotto corrected this Part of their Cookery,
and having gutted the Fish before he broiled it, he found his Comrades
very well pleas'd, and they always managed it so after.

While he pass'd his Life here pleasantly enough, one Day the _Accabo_,
or King, sent a Guard to fetch him to the City; he was extreamly
frightened at this unexpected Turn, and enquired of those that conducted
him, into the Meaning of it, but they could give him no Account of it,
but hurried him along very quick; when they arriv'd at the City, they
did not carry him before the _Accabo_, or King, as he expected, but
conducted him strait to the _Haulob_, or Prison, where he had been
before confined. He had not been there above two Hours when his old
Friend _Morasab_ came to make him a Visit, whose Opinion he ask'd
concerning his Confinement, _Morasab_ told him, he judged it to be for
no other Reason, than because there had been a _Schabew_, or Ship, seen
that Morning at a great Distance off the Coast, that there were Men on
the Hills then watching of her, and others lying in Wait to surprize any
that should attempt to come on Shore. While they were in Discourse, the
_Kasboo_ or Jaylor came in with some boiled Rice and Fish, and confirmed
what _Morasab_ had told him, and cheared him up by assuring him, that no
Harm was intended him, that he was only confined to prevent his making
his Escape. The Molotto knowing that every Thing he should say, would be
told again the King, because any Person may speak to him with the utmost
Freedom at any Time, except when he is sitting in Judgment, told the
_Kasboo_, that he had given over all Thoughts of visiting his native
Country more, having neither Wife nor Children; nor was he desirous of
seeing any other Part of that Country, having taken a firm Resolution to
obey the Orders very punctually of never going beyond the Limits of the
_Moorzacks_; the _Kasboo_ told him, that if he had any Value for his
Life, it would be best for him to do so, for if he should at any Time be
catch'd attempting any Escape, he would be served just as the white Men
had been, the Molotto answered he should deserve it, since the King had
been so gracious to him, not only to give him his Life, but to appoint
him to live in a Place which he liked above any Thing he had ever seen.

All this Discourse was reported that Night to the King, the Consequence
of which was, that he was sent for the next Morning; the first Question
the King ask'd him was, whether that _Shabew_ or Ship which had appear'd
in Sight, was the same in which he came? He answered, he could not tell,
unless he was to see it, (but that could not be done now, for she was
gone off without coming to an Anchor, or sending her Boat on Shore.) The
King then ask'd him, whether he had a Desire to return back to the
_Moorzacks_? He answered, it was what he longed for of all Things, and
repeated the same Things concerning the Pleasure he took in that Place,
which he had done before to the _Kasboo_; he found this tickled the
King's Vanity, and put him into good Humour, wherefore, he commanded him
to be conducted back, whither he arrived with a much lighter Heart than
he left it, having the Satisfaction also of seeing his Comrades mighty
well pleas'd at his safe Return amongst them.

Here he pass'd his Time without any Care, having every Thing provided
for him, being at Leisure all the Day long to divert himself as he
would, for except taking his Watch in his Turn, he had nothing to do,
but to clean the _Moorzacks_ every new Moon, both within and without,
and to take Care that the Lamps around them should be supplied with Oil,
and never go out.

He observ'd his Companions employed their Leisure Time all in some Work,
most of them in making some little Curiosities, which the Towns-People
used to walk out, and buy of them, and which enabled them to purchase
Liquor and other Things they had an Inclination for; his Comrade in
particular used to amuse himself with making Fishing-Nets, but these
Nets are very different from those used in _Europe_, they are made of
Sea-Grass, wove out into a certain Length, and the Fisherman before he
uses them, fastens to them a certain Number of Hooks (for they are
ignorant of the Art of contriving Nets to catch Fish without Hooks) his
Comrade with a great Deal of Ease used to make one of these a Week, and
he observing how he work'd them, did not doubt but he could do the same;
therefore he begg'd of his Comrade to give him a little of his
Sea-Grass, with which he began to make Trial, and succeeded so well,
that in a few Days he finished a Net, which he truck'd away for a
Quantity of Sea Grass.

He was now set up for a new Trade, and was so industrious in it, that he
work'd his Nets with much more Curiosity than any of his Partners, and
of Consequence had better Business; so that in a little Time he was able
to purchase a Piece of Dungeree Linnen with his own Earnings, of which
he made himself a Wastecoat after the _English_ Fashion, and a Pair of
long Drawers; but he had not worn them above a Day or two when the
_Bankoo_, or Steward of the _Moorzacks_, commanded him to leave off the
Wastecoat, that he might appear like the rest, who wore nothing but a
Piece of any Stuff they could get, about their Wastes, to cover their
Nakedness.

Upon the whole, he found he should have no great Occasion to provide for
his Back, which occasioned his being less diligent in his Work; however,
he purchased a _Mohaz_ Covering to keep him warm in the Night, with the
_Bankoo_'s Permission, and happening to talk sometimes with his Comrades
about Nets, and describing how they were made in _Europe_, the _Bankoo_
asked him if he could make one in the same Manner? But finding he was
not to lay out his Earnings to please himself, he answered, he could
not; however, an Accident fell out soon after which brought him into
great Favour.

As it was Part of his Duty to go to the _Bankoo_'s generally in the
Morning, for the Allowance of Provision for the Day for himself and
Comrade, he observed, that tho' their Allowance was sufficient in all
other Respects, it was very short as to Salt. One Day, when they had
Plantanes, Rice and Oil, he begg'd hard for a little more Salt, but the
_Bankoo_ told him it could not be done without defrauding some of the
rest, for Salt is exceeding scarce amongst them, having no Way of making
it, nor any Way of providing it but by searching among the Rocks, near
the Sea Side, where they pick it up in Bits about the Bigness of a Nut,
and sometimes larger; here Nature makes it by the continual beating of
the Sea in one Place; but the Quantities they are able to procure this
Way are very small; wherefore, finding himself disappointed, he happened
to say, that if he was at Liberty he could make Salt as plenty in
_Magadoxa_ as it was in _Europe_. The _Bankoo_ the same Day acquainted
the _Accabo_ with what he had said, so that the next Day he was sent
for: He was no sooner arrived in the Presence of the _Accabo_ but he
immediately asked him if he could make Salt? He answered, he believed he
could, (and the Truth on't was he had often seen it made.) At the same
Time he described the Manner of making it. The _Accabo_ immediately
order'd him to go to Work, and to have what Assistance he requir'd; he
did so, and was so industrious and successful in it, that in six Months
Salt was as plenty amongst them as any where else.

The _Accabo_ sent for him again, and inquired of him concerning
Fishing-Nets, as they were used in _Europe_: He described them to him;
upon which he asked him if he could make one of them? He had been asked
the same Question before by the _Bankoo_, and denied that he had any
Skill that Way; but considering with himself now that since he was
likely to pass his whole Life amongst these People, it was his Business
to gain their Favour all the Ways he could, he answered, he never had
made any; however, if he (the _Accabo_) thought fit, he would try and do
the best he could.

The _Accabo_ seemed mightily pleased with his Willingness, and asked him
if he should want any to assist him? He answered he should, and desired
eight Persons to be employed in Spinning, and six in Knitting. These
People were to follow his Directions, accordingly they fell to Work,
and, in the Space of two Months, finished a Net eighty Fathom long.

When it was finished the _Accabo_ himself had a Mind to see what Effect
it would have beyond their own Nets; accordingly he went on board one of
their Junks, attended by his Favourites, having with him also several of
their most experienced Fishermen: They had the good Luck to take a good
Number of Fish the first Hawl, among which were several Sorts they had
never before seen, being such Fish as will not take the Hook, and such
as always keep deep in the Water. The _Accabo_ appeared highly contented
with this Success, and ordered several more of them to be made, which
could be done without him now that he had shewn them a Way, so that Fish
soon became infinitely more plenty than ever it had been before.

The Molotto expected no less than to be rewarded with some extraordinary
Recompence for the publick Services; the least Favour he thought could
be granted him would be to give him the Liberty of a Freeman, and to let
him live as an Inhabitant of the City, and to get his living amongst
them, by any Sort of Industry he could; but he found himself greatly
mistaken, for all his Reward consisted in being sent back to the
_Moorzacks_, upon the same Foot he had been before.

It is true, he passed his Time here with a great deal of Tranquility,
and began to reconcile himself to the Thoughts of remaining there his
whole Life, he was convinced that nothing he could do to ingratiate
himself, would procure him any Favour or Liberty; and an Accident fell
out which gave him a terrible Notion of their Severity: One of the
_Passaus_ or Guards, on a Night when it was not his Turn to be upon the
Watch, went privately into the City, contrary to Orders, and returned
again before it was Day, but not so privately but he was seen by some
Person, who went and discovered it to the _Accabo_; the Consequence of
which was, that he was sent for under a Guard the next Morning, and,
being brought into the King's Presence, was, without any more Ceremony,
executed in the following Manner: He was obliged to kneel down, leaning
his Head forwards, whilst the Executioner, with a heavy Bar of Timber,
struck him on the lower part of his Head, and beat out his Brains.

This Example so terrified the poor Molotto, that in fifteen Years he was
in that Place he never ventured beyond the Limits, except when he was
sent for by the _Accabo_, or to attend a Burial, which he was obliged to
do when any of the _Passaus_ or Guards died, for they were not buried
among the _Moorzacks_, no more than any of the other of the common
People.

But it is Time that we describe this Place, which is not only the
greatest Curiosity of this Country, but would pass for a Piece of
Magnificence in those Nations where Arts and Sciences are known, and it
is fit to be the more particular in it, as it may appear strange, that
those People who are Barbarians in all other Respects, should observe so
much Pomp and Decoration in their funeral Ceremonies.

This burying Place, which they call _Hoynatz_, is pleasantly situated in
a beautiful Valley between two Hills, about two _English_ Miles from the
City of _Magadoxa_; there are in it twenty nine _Moorzacks_, or Tombs,
all which were first built by the Kings, at whose Expence the _Passaus_
or Guards are kept, their being four to each _Moorzack_, who watch two
and two by Turns, who take Care of the Lamps, which continually burn
within, and keep every Thing clean to the greatest Nicety.

Tho' these _Moorzacks_ may be said properly all to belong to the King,
yet several other Persons of the first Rank are buried in them, by the
King's special Favour, for he sometimes gives a _Moorzack_ to some
Favourite, as a burying Place for his Family; notwithstanding which
Gift, when any of the said Family dies, the King's Permission must be
asked anew for burying him in the _Moorzack_, the Reason is, that it
frequently happens that when a Person who has this Kind of Right to be
buried in a _Moorzack_ disobliges the King, he takes no Notice of it as
long as the Party lives; but when he dies, he forbids him to be buried
in the _Moorzack_, by way of Punishment.

This may shew what a Veneration they have for these Places, when they
seem to think that all Happiness, as well as Honour, consisted in laying
the Body after Death in one of these _Moorzacks_; and, indeed, it is one
of the chief Pleasures of the King, as well as of the common People to
visit these Places often, which they do with a Kind of religious
Respect.

The largest _Moorzack_ or Tomb of all is the King's own, no other Person
being ever buried therein; it is eighty Foot square, built of black and
white Marble mix'd, with a Kind of Cupola at Top, and over it a long
Spire, the Inside, both Floor and Sides, is white Marble curiously
polished, and the Cieling or Cupola painted green: There are in it forty
five _Boozes_ of Gold, standing on as many Pedestals of black Marble, of
about four Foot high.

A _Booze_ is a kind of round Pot with a Cover, about eight Inches deep,
and five Diameter, in which are placed the Ashes of the Dead of those
that are deposited there; I say the Ashes, because the Bodies are first
burned.

There are also sixteen large Lamps of Gold, with nine Lights to each,
four in a Corner, and one large one in the Middle, with two Lights; the
large ones are never lighted but at Funerals, when they make a fine
Shew, but that in the Middle burns constantly.

By the forty five _Boozes_, wherein are deposited the Ashes, it may be
conjectured that as many of their Kings lie there, and so the Molotto
was informed.

The second for Largeness belongs to the _Cossues_ or Queens, (for, it
must be observed, that the Males and Females are never buried in the
same _Moorzack_:) It is built all of white Marble, and is fifty nine
Foot square, the inside Wall exactly the same with the outside, but the
Floor is of black and white Marble laid in Squares, much like what may
be seen in Noblemens Houses in _Europe_. There are fifty six _Boozes_ of
Gold, standing on black Marble Pedestals; there are twelve large Lamps,
each with seven Lights, three in each Corner, and one of Silver in the
Middle, which burns constantly, as in the King's.

The third belongs to the _Acobibs_, or Princes; it is also built of
white Marble; its Form is exactly round, being seventy nine Foot in
Circumference; there are in it fifty three _Boozes_ standing on black
Marble Pedestals, with thirteen Lamps of Silver with seven Lights each;
twelve of them are plac'd in a circular Form, and the thirteenth in the
Middle, which burns constantly, the Cieling is painted green.

The fourth belongs to the _Matotzes_ or Princesses; It is built of a
greenish Marble, vein'd with black, being of a circular Form like that
of the _Acobibs_ or Princes, and much about the same in Circumference;
the inside Wall is of white Marble; the Floor of various Colours, as
black, white, and green; and the Cieling which is made in the Form of a
Cupola, is yellow: It hath sixty four _Boozes_, standing on Pedestals of
black and white Marble, and eight large Silver Lamps with seven Lights
to each, placed in a circular Form, besides one in the middle which
burns constantly.

The fifth belongs to the _Foramzeps_ or Male Children of the Prince; it
is built of a white Marble, with large black Veins in it, both the
inside Wall and Floor being of a light grey Marble; it is thirty Foot
square, having nineteen _Boozes_ of Gold, and sixty of Silver, standing
on Pedestals of the same Sort of Marble, with the outside Wall; there
are in it eight large Silver Lamps, hanging two in each Corner, besides
one in the middle which burns continually.

The sixth _Moorzack_ belongs to the _Squeenzibs_ or Female Children of
the Prince; it is built of a curious red Marble, with Veins of white
running thro' it, and is twenty eight Foot square, the inside Wall and
Floor being of white Marble; it has a hundred and nineteen _Boozes_ of
Silver standing on Pedestals of a blewish grey Marble; it has eight
Silver Lamps disposed two in a Corner, besides one in the middle that
burns continually.

All these here taken Notice of, belong to those of the King's own Blood,
but as it may seem a little too tedious to be particular in the
Description of them all, we shall only observe who the great Persons
are, who are distinguished by having _Moorzacks_ assigned to them alone,
or to their Families.

First, There is one appointed for the burying Place of the _Baamzan_ or
chief Priest; one to the _Baulumzu_ or Treasurer; one to the
_Jocybauthaux_ or chief Councellor; one to the _Moorenzep_ or Head
General;--one to the _Caffa_ or Secretary;--one to the _Paremzebs_,
which are a few People so called by Way of Title, and are their chief
Nobility;--one to their Wives, whom they call _Tepshoyes_;--one to the
_Morepzus_ or Generals of the Elephants;--one to the _Hammons_ or
Governors of Towns;--one to the _Hoyzepa_ or Head Teacher of the
Elephants;--one to the _Sancof_ or Head Doctor.

There is also one particularly kept for such as not being otherwise
intitled to this Honour, shall perform some brave Action in the
War--there is one belonging to the _Zanshaw_ or Master of the King's
Musick--One to the _Divatzabowes_ or Concubines of the King--One to the
_Panpuzams_ or Male Children of the King's Concubines--One to the
_Parrasquas_ or Male Children of the High Priest--One to the _Gauzets_
or Wives of the chief General--One to the _Matotzas_ or Wives of the
Governors of Towns--One to the _Hoydenebs_ or Wives of the
Treasurer--One to the _Okenzegs_ or Wives of the chief Councellor.

But when I mention a _Moorzack_ to belong to the Treasurer, or to the
General, it must not be understood to be for the Use of him and his
Heirs, but the next Person who succeeds in his Post is to be buried
there, and his Heirs are no Ways intitled, unless they happen to succeed
him in his Post.

These are all built of Marble of different Colours, some larger, and
some less, some square, others quite round, some having a small Spire at
Top, and others without; yet the Ornaments within are as rich in many of
them, as in those belonging to the King or Prince--As for Example, in
the _Moorzack_ of the _Baamzan_ or high Priest, of the _Baumlozn_ or
Treasurer, of the _Morewzep_ or General, and of the _Caffa_ or
Secretary, the _Boozes_ are all Gold; in others there are some of Gold
and some of Silver, and considering what a great Number there are of
them, these Monuments contain a vast Wealth.

When the King, Prince, or any other Person who is intitled to a Place in
one of these Monuments dies, the Corps is immediately stripp'd naked,
(let it be Man or Woman) after which, it is laid upon a Bier, and a thin
Piece of Purple Silk being thrown over it, it is carried to be lain in
State for some Days to a certain House, or Hall, built for that Purpose,
a little Way without the City.--This Building consists of one large
Room, sixty Foot in Length, and twenty six broad, being thirty Foot
high, and flat at Top; the Stone is a curious white Marble, it is
illuminated within with a great Number of Silver Lamps; in the middle
stands a white Marble Table, supported by six Marble Pedestals about
three Foot high, on which is laid the Body.

When they intend to remove it to the _Hoynabs_ or burying Place, they
exactly observe the Setting of the Sun; at which Time comes the chief
Priest, attended by all those who have a Right to be buried in these
Places (for no others must assist upon these Occasions) and drawing out
a sharp Instrument, which they call a _Mockdoo_, and which serves the
Use of a Knife, he opens the Body of the deceas'd, takes out the Heart,
and delivers it into the Hands of the nearest Relation, who stands ready
for that Purpose, at the Priest's right Hand; when this is done, the
Body is carried to the lower End of the Hall, where a Fire is prepared
in a Hole, five Foot deep in the Ground, and about as many broad; the
Body is put into the said Fire, where it is consumed; then the Heart is
again delivered into the Hands of the Priest, who places it in a little
Stone-Pot, and puts it into the Fire, where it remains till it is dried
to a Powder; then the Ashes of the Body being dried up, are put into the
_Booze_, as is also the Heart; after which, they proceed to the
_Hoynatz_, the nearest Relation carrying the _Booze_. When they arrive
at the _Moorzack_, which upon this Occasion is all illuminated, the
_Booze_ is again delivered into the Hands of the Priest, who going into
the _Moorzack_ alone, shuts the Door after him, he remains a Quarter of
an Hour, places the _Booze_ upon the Pedestal prepared for it, and then
returns, which makes an End of the whole Ceremony.

All this is done without a Word; nor is there any Sign of Sorrow or
Lamentation amongst the Kindred, of the deceas'd, nor is it the Custom
ever to speak of him, or name him at all after he is dead.

Thus we have given an Account of the Order and Ceremonies of their
Funerals, and of the Magnificence of their Monuments, which make a most
glorious Shew at a Distance, nor are they less beautiful when near, the
Materials of which they are built being very fine, and their Scituation
delightful.

But as to their Religion we can give but imperfect Accounts, for they
scarce know what it is themselves; they never ask'd the Molotto one Word
concerning his Religion, and when he enquired of theirs, they had very
little to say about it, but told such an incoherent Story, that he could
make neither Head nor Tail of it. There is a Mosque or Temple about half
a Mile out of the City, of which they give a fabulous Account, as that
it was built in one Night, but no Man could tell how, or by whom; but
their general Opinion was, that it was built by _Hios_ God of the Sea,
and at certain Times they used to flock, and pay a Kind of Devotion
there, but they could not tell why or wherefore. However by the best
Observations our Molotto could make, it appear'd to him as if they had
several Worships amongst them, for he took Notice that some paid their
Devotions to a little Image, not unlike a Wolf, which they kept in their
Houses, and which are so common, that the poorer Sort of People make
them of Bits of Wood, of about four or five Inches long, and sell them
about the Streets.

They bear no Sort of Hatred or Antipathy to Christians, as Christians,
as we see the _Turks_ and most of the Sects of _Mahomet_ do; but the
Truth on't is, they do not know what a Christian is, yet (as we observed
before) they are bred up in a Notion that white Men are all a Kind of
Monsters, and they hate and detest them, as we do Toads or other
poisonous Creatures, not for their Religion, but their Colour. In
Respect to one another they observe the Laws of Society very well, and
perhaps there is less Fraud and fewer Acts of Injustice committed
amongst them, than in any Christian Country we can name. So that our
Molotto who was now in a Manner naturaliz'd amongst them, and whose
Complexion was black enough not to appear odious and terrible to them,
was as well used as the rest of the _Passaus_ or Guards, or any other
Person of equal Rank with him.

It is certain he once flattered himself with the Hopes of being placed
in a better Condition of Life amongst them, or being set at full
Liberty, by Way of Recompence, for his instructing them in some useful
Things, which proved of publick Advantage to them, but he had long laid
aside those vain Thoughts, for he found the _Accabo_ had no Notion of
Generosity, or Gratitude: He, therefore, with a Kind of Philosophy,
seem'd to confine his Wishes to that melancholy quiet Life he was
obliged to lead within the Limits of the _Moorzacks_, till an Accident
fell out, which quite changed his Sentiments in this Respect, and which
proves how natural the Love of Liberty is to Man.

It happened that the _Hamman_ or Governor of the Town of _Saeni_, a
Place about twenty Leagues to the Eastward of _Magadoxa_, in the same
Kingdom of _Zanguebar_, having committed some Violences, by which he got
the ill Will of the People, they rose against him, and kill'd him. This
News was no sooner brought to _Magadoxa_, than the _Accabo_, tho' he
keeps no Army or Guards, except the _Passaus_ to watch the _Moorzacks_,
immediately rais'd a Body of two thousand Men, arm'd with Bows and
Arrows, and march'd in Person at the Head of them, to suppress the
Rebels. The second Days March, Advice was brought him that the _Schabew_
or Ship had been seen near a little Town call'd _Bandan_, ten Leagues
Eastward of _Saeni_, and thirty of _Magadoxa_: Upon which Intelligence,
he forthwith commanded six Men to march back to the _Moorzacks_ as
expeditiously as they could, in order to fetch our Molotto, and with him
to join the Army as soon as they could. They found him upon his Duty,
and commanded him to march away immediately, with his Bow and Arrows,
which were the Arms that belonged to him, as a _Passau_ or Guard of the
Moorzacks, so that he seem'd to march as a Soldier more than a Prisoner.

After two Days hard March they came up with the Army which had made a
Halt, at some Distance from the Town of _Saeni_, and the _Accabo_ having
sent out a Detachment to lie in Ambuscade near the Town, they took some
Prisoners, who being brought in, declared that all the Inhabitants had
abandoned the Town upon the News of the King's Approach, and were fled
away for Fear. At the same Time they gave such Instances of the Tyranny
of the late _Hamman_ or Governor, and of the Necessity they were under
of doing as they did, that the King appeared satisfied with their
Behaviour; and to lay aside all Resentment, ordered several of them to
go and find out the Rest, and give them Notice, that they might return
to their Habitations, for that all was pardon'd, and that he would send
them a better Governor. And, as if all had been over, the next Day he
began to move with his Army back towards _Magadoxa_, but marched
extreamly slow; towards Night, they came near a great Wood, into which
he commanded his whole Army to enter, in order to lie that Night; the
next Morning he gave Orders that no Man upon Pain of Death should go out
of the Wood.

In the mean Time the scattered Inhabitants of _Saeni_ having heard the
good News, were returning to their Habitations; but no sooner was it
dark that Night, but the _Accabo_ gave Orders for a March, and making
all the Expedition they could, they silently enter'd the Town of _Saeni_
before Morning, while the Inhabitants newly return'd were all asleep;
however, they were alarm'd, and running into the Streets, the _Accabo_
commanded his Men to fall upon them, who killed a great Number of them,
whilst a great many favoured by the Darkness of the Night, had the good
Luck to make their Escape; but of those that could not escape by Flight,
there were only forty three made Prisoners, all the Rest being kill'd.

Our Molotto happen'd to fall into Discourse with one of these Prisoners,
who lamenting the hard Fate, of his poor Townsmen, and giving him an
Account of their Flight from the City, and their Return back, told him,
that as they went near the Sea-side, about ten Leagues from thence, and
a League or two from _Bandon_, they saw a _Schabew_ or Ship, and so
described him the Way to the Place where she lay; the Molotto perceiv'd
it was directly East of the Place they were then at, _viz._ _Saeni_, he
ask'd several Questions concerning the Size of the Ship, the Prisoner
answer'd him to the best of his Understanding; and in his Manner of
describing her, gave the Molotto to understand, that her Yards and
Topmasts were down, which was a Sign she designed to lye there some
Time; he then desired to know of him when he had seen her last, he
answered him two Days before.

It immediately came into his Head that Providence had now given him the
Means of making his Escape, and that in all Probability if he miss'd
this, he never would have an Opportunity more; he knew that nothing
could hinder him from making off by Night, and that in all Probability,
he would be gone several Hours before he should be miss'd; so that he
flattered himself, that those who should be sent in Pursuit of him would
never overtake him, tho' they should hit the right Way, and he thought
it might very well happen they should be out there too.

All that Day he pass'd betwixt Hope and Fear, sometimes he was terrified
at the dismal Apprehensions of losing his Way himself, or of the Ship's
being sail'd off, in either of which Cases there was nothing for him but
certain Destruction, for he could have no Chance of concealing himself
in the Country as a Native might do.--On the other Side, he spirited
himself up with an Assurance that the Ship could not be yet sail'd,
having her Yards and Topmasts down but two Days before; and again, that
he knew so well how the Place bore, that there could be no Danger of his
losing his Way; so that that Day he did nothing but mark out the Way
with his Eye, that he intended to go, at his first setting out.

As soon as all was silent that Night, and his Comrades (who were a Kind
of Guards upon him) were all asleep, he ventured to set out, nor did he
meet with any Frights or Interruptions at the Beginning, getting clear
of the Army without being questioned, or so much as seen or heard of
any; for as they knew nothing of military Discipline, they have no
Centinels in the Night. He marched all Night with all his Might, for
indeed it was for Life; in the Morning when the Day was clear, he saw a
little Town about two Miles from him, he judg'd this to be the Town of
_Bandon_, by the Description which the Prisoner gave him of it; he
guessed now that he was near the Sea, and that it was nothing but the
high Land before him, which hindered him from the Sight of it; he
therefore set his best Foot forwards, to gain the Top of one of the
Hills before him; when he reached the Top, he had a fair View of the
Ocean, and looking stedfastly every Way, he fancied he saw something
like a Ship Eastward, but it was so far off, it was scarce discernable,
however, it revived his Heart, and he now thought himself safe; he also
perceived a pretty large River, at some Distance below him, in the
Valleys, which he must of Necessity pass, because it lay directly in his
Way, but as he was expert at Swimming, this gave him no great Dread,
therefore he made the best of his Way towards the said River; when he
arrived at the Banks, he perceived it was so rapid, that he apprehended
(he being a little weakened with the Fatigue of his Journey) the Current
would be too strong for him, and carry him into the Sea; he thought
therefore, there was no Way for him to get over, but to walk up further
in the Country, to find a Place where the Course of the River was
crooked, which always breaks the Rapidity of the Stream, and where he
might cross with less Danger.

While he was considering on this Matter, he chanced to look about, and
turning his Eyes upwards towards the Hill from whence he was newly
descended, and which was now betwixt two and three Miles Distance from
him, he saw six Men on the Top thereof; they seemed to stand still and
look about them for a while, but suddenly they started forwards, and
with great Precipitation made directly towards him; he could think no
less than that they were some sent in Pursuit of him, and that their
standing still at first, was to no other Purpose, than to try if they
could see him, and that their discovering him, was the Occasion of their
running so suddenly down the Hill afterwards. The Fear of the cruel
Death he should suffer, in Case he should be taken, hinder'd all further
Consideration, so that without any more examining them, he plunged
himself into the River, the Current was very strong, however, he made
Shift to stem it better than he expected; and when he got over near the
other Side, Providence so order'd it, that he was forced into a Part of
the River, where there was an eddy Water, which drove him upon the Bank,
so that in about the Space of half an Hour or a little more, he landed
safely on the other Side.

He was a little spent with his Swimming, when sitting down to take a
little Breath, he saw a Sight which terrified him as much as an Army of
Enemies at his Heels could have done; it was a monstruous Aligator lying
near the Bank-side, it appeared like some prodigious Oak in the Water,
and he has declared and given it under his Hand, that it seemed to him
large enough to swallow an Ox. At the same Time he beheld his Pursuers,
who were now arrived pretty near the opposite Bank, he started up, and
wing'd with Fear, flew rather than run, and there being some shrubby low
Wood near the River, he had Presence of Mind enough to make his Way
through them, knowing that if the Monster should follow him, it could
not pass that Way, because the Thickness of the Wood would hinder it,
besides it must presently lose Sight of him, and indeed it is likely,
that he owed his Escape to this lucky Thought; he run on with greater
Swiftness than at his first setting out, (for his Fear had supplied him
with new Spirits,) but not without often looking back, which gave him
the Comfort of knowing that the Monster and his Pursuers were both out
of Sight: When he had continued this Pace about two Hours, he came to a
Valley betwixt two rising Grounds, which lay open to the Sea, where he
was joyfully surprized with a full View of the Ship lying at an Anchor,
not above a Mile from the Shore, he hastened immediately towards the
Edge of the Water, and made a Signal to them, by waving his Cap over his
Head, for he thought it to no Purpose to hollow or call, because they
were at too great a Distance to hear him. He continued this Action a
considerable Time, and began to grow impatient and uneasy to the last
Degree, because he saw them return no Signal in Answer to him, whereby
he might understand that they saw him, or intended to succour him; but
he was soon relieved from this Fright also, by the sudden Appearance of
the Boat which was coming round the Point of Land very near him, she
being employed for some Time in rowing along Shore, in order to discover
if the Country was inhabited.

So great was his Joy at this Sight, and such was his Eagerness of
speaking with them, knowing by their Dress they were _Europeans_, that
he had not Patience to wait for their coming to him, but he ran hastily
into the Water to meet them; when he waded up to the Neck, he set
himself afloat and swam to the Boat, they proved to be _Dutchmen_;
however, they took him in, and observing the extream Satisfaction and
Joy which appeared in his Countenance, they were very desirous of
knowing who he was, and whence he came, they spoke to him in _Dutch_,
and tho' he knew but little of that Language, yet he made a Shift to let
them understand that he spoke _English_; there were two or three amongst
them that understood our Language, and one of them spoke it very well;
when he knew this, he gave them to understand in few Words that he was a
Christian, that he had been a Prisoner or Slave in that Country for
sixteen Years, that he had now made his Escape, and was pursued by six
Barbarians who were once come in Sight of him.

As they had Arms in their Boat, they had a Mind to stay a-while and see
whether these Barbarians would appear, for they had not beheld a human
Creature since they had lain there, and were of Opinion that the Country
was not inhabited, (tho' the Ship had been seen from the Hills by the
Natives) so they lay upon their Oars.

In about half an Hour five Men appear'd arm'd with Bows and Arrows, and
running a great Pace, they came to the Water-side, and beheld the Boat,
which was but a little Distance from them; the _Dutchmen_ fired two
Musquets, upon which they dispersed and fled hastily away, but a little
while after two of them came back again, and throwing down their Bows
and Arrows, upon the Shore-side, plung'd into the Sea, and seem'd to
direct their Way towards the Boat; the _Dutchmen_ were surpriz'd what
they could mean, but however, as nothing was to be fear'd from two naked
Men, they lay still to see what it would come to: In fine, the two
Barbarians swam to the Boat, and speaking to the Molotto, begg'd to be
taken in, and to go along with them, for that they should certainly be
put to some cruel Death if they went back, for not having taken him and
brought him back with them.

The _Dutchmen_ were willing to receive them, knowing they would be worth
Money to be sold for Slaves. When they got into the Boat, they gave an
Account of losing one of their Company in swimming over the River, where
they first had Sight of the Molotto, who was devoured by an Alligator,
in all Probability the same the Molotto had seen, and that the other
three would travel as far as they could from their own Country, in order
to save their Lives; but for their Parts, they chose rather to put
themselves on the Mercy of the white Men, than run the Hazard of being
taken, or starved in passing thro' Countries they did not know.

When he came on Board the Ship, he related to the Captain the whole
Story of his Adventures, who finding he had been a Sea-faring Man, and
that he understood Navigation pretty well, put him upon the Foot of an
able Seaman.

They remain'd here about three Weeks, the Winds continuing contrary till
then, in which Time they laid in Water and Wood, and diverted themselves
with Fishing; after this they sail'd for _Batavia_ in the _East-Indies_,
where having unladed and taken in a Cargoe of _India_ Goods, they sail'd
home for _Holland_; the Molotto made two or three Voyages with them, but
in the Year 1724, he being in _Holland_, and having a great Desire to
see his old Captain, he embark'd on the 28th of _March_ in _Holland_,
and pass'd into _England_, he found out his Captain who was alive, and
who being overjoy'd to see him, prov'd very generous to him, and
prevail'd with him to give in Writing the Particulars of all his
Adventures, from whose Copy the foregoing Narrative is faithfully taken.

As to the Molotto he return'd back to _Holland_, and sails still in the
Service of the _Dutch East-India_ Company, unless he is lately dead.


                                   OF
                            Capt. _BELLAMY_.

As we cannot, with any Certainty, deduce this Man from his Origin, we
shall begin where we find him first a declared Enemy to Mankind. Capt.
_Bellamy_ and _Paul Williams_, in two Sloops, had been upon a _Spanish_
Wreck, and not finding their Expectation answered, as has been mentioned
in former Parts of this History, they resolved not to lose their Labour,
and agreed to go upon the Account, a Term among the Pyrates, which
speaks their Profession. The first, who had the Misfortune to fall in
their Way, was Captain _Prince_, bound from _Jamaica_ to _London_, in a
Galley built at that Port, whose Cargo consisted of Elephants Teeth,
Gold Dust, and other rich Merchandize. This Prize not only enrich'd, but
strengthened them; they immediately mounted this Galley with 28 Guns,
and put aboard 150 Hands of different Nations; _Bellamy_ was declared
Captain, and the Vessel had her old Name continued, which was _Whidaw_:
This happen'd about the latter End of _February_, 1717. They, now thus
fitted for the continuing of their desperate Resolution, shaped their
Course for _Virginia_, which Coast they very much infested, taking
several Vessels: They were upon shifting this Station, when they were
very near, as the Psalmist expresses it, _going quick down into Hell_,
for the Heaven's beginning to lowre, prognosticated a Storm; at the
first Appearance of the Sky being likely to be overcast, _Bellamy_ took
in all his small Sails, and _Williams_ double reefed his main Sail,
which was hardly done when a Thunder Shower overtook them with such
Violence, that the _Whidaw_ was very near over-setting; they immediately
put before the Wind, for they had no other Way of working, having only
the Goose Wings of the Fore-Sail to scud with; happy for them the Wind
was at _West_ and by _North_, for had it been Easterly, they must have
infallibly perish'd upon the Coast. The Storm encreased towards Night,
and not only put them by all Sail, but obliged the _Whidaw_ to bring her
Yards aportland, and all they could do with Tackles to the Goose Neck of
the Tiller, four Men in the Gun Room, and two at the Wheel, was to keep
her Head to the Sea, for had she once broach'd to, they must infallibly
have founder'd. The Heavens, in the mean while, were cover'd with Sheets
of Lightning, which the Sea by the Agitation of the saline Particles
seem'd to imitate; the Darkness of the Night was such, as the Scripture
says, as might be felt; the terrible hollow roaring of the Winds, cou'd
be only equalled by the repeated, I may say, incessant Claps of Thunder,
sufficient to strike a Dread of the supream Being, who commands the Sea
and the Winds, one would imagine in every Heart; but among these
Wretches, the Effect was different, for they endeavoured by their
Blasphemies, Oaths, and horrid Imprecations, to drown the Uproar of
jarring Elements. _Bellamy_ swore he was sorry he could not run out his
Guns to return the Salute, meaning the Thunder, that he fancied the Gods
had got drunk over their Tipple, and were gone together by the Ears:
They continued scudding all that Night under their bare Poles, the next
Morning the Main-Mast being sprung in the Step, they were forced to cut
it away, and, at the same time, the Mizzen came by the Board. These
Misfortunes made the Ship ring with Blasphemy, which was encreased,
when, by trying the Pumps, they found the Ship made a great Deal of
Water; tho' by continually plying them, it kept it from gaining upon
them: The Sloop as well as the Ship, was left to the Mercy of the Winds,
tho' the former, not having a Tant-Mast, did not lose it. The Wind
shifting round the Compass, made so outrageous and short a Sea, that
they had little Hopes of Safety; it broke upon the Poop, drove in the
Taveril, and wash'd the two Men away from the Wheel, who were saved in
the Netting. The Wind after four Days and three Nights abated of its
Fury, and fixed in the North, North East Point, hourly decreasing, and
the Weather clearing up, so that they spoke to the Sloop, and resolv'd
for the Coast of _Carolina_; they continued this Course but a Day and a
Night, when the Wind coming about to the Southward, they changed their
Resolution to that of going to _Rhode Island_. All this while the
_Whidaw_'s Leak continued, and it was as much as the Lee-Pump could do
to keep the Water from gaining, tho' it was kept continually going.
Jury-Masts were set up, and the Carpenter finding the Leak to be in the
Bows, occasioned by the Oakam spewing out of a Seam, the Crew became
very jovial again; the Sloop received no other Damage than the Loss of
the Main-Sail, which the first Flurry tore away from the Boom. In their
Cruise off _Rhode Island_, the Beginning of _April_, they took a Sloop
commanded by Capt. _Beer_, belonging to _Boston_, in the Lat. of _South
Carolina_, 40 Leagues from Land; they put the said Captain on Board the
_Whidaw_ Commodore, while they rifled and plundered his Vessel, which
_Williams_ and _Bellamy_ proposed returning to him, but the Crews being
averse to it, they sunk her, and put the Captain ashore upon _Block
Island_.

I can't pass by in Silence, Capt. _Bellamy_'s Speech to Capt. _Beer_.
D--n my Bl--d_, says he, _I am sorry they won't let you have your Sloop
again, for I scorn to do any one a Mischief, when it is not for my
Advantage; damn the Sloop, we must sink her, and she might be of Use to
you. Tho', damn ye, you are a sneaking Puppy, and so are all those who
will submit to be governed by Laws which rich Men have made for their
own Security, for the cowardly Whelps have not the Courage otherwise to
defend what they get by their Knavery; but damn ye altogether: Damn them
for a Pack of crafty Rascals, and you, who serve them, for a Parcel of
hen-hearted Numskuls. They villify us, the Scoundrels do, when there is
only this Difference, they rob the Poor under the Cover of Law,
forsooth, and we plunder the Rich under the Protection of our own
Courage; had you not better make One of us, than sneak after the A--s of
these Villains for Employment? Capt. _Beer_ told him, that his
Conscience would not allow him to break thro' the Laws of God and Man.
You are a devilish Conscience Rascal, d--n ye, replied _Bellamy_, I am a
free Prince, and I have as much Authority to make War on the whole
World, as he who has a hundred Sail of Ships at Sea, and an Army of
100,000 Men in the Field; and this my Conscience tells me; but there is
no arguing with such sniveling Puppies, who allow Superiors to kick them
about Deck at Pleasure; and pin their Faith upon a Pimp of a Parson; a
Squab, who neither practices nor believes what he puts upon the
chuckle-headed Fools he preaches to.--The Pyrates wanting neither
Provision nor Water, and the _Whidaw_'s Damage being repaired, they past
their Time very jovially. One of the Crew had been a Stroler, a Fellow
who had pass'd thro' a great many real as well as fictitious Scenes of
Life, the stroling Business not answering the Greatness of his Soul (as
he expressed it) he thought it more profitable, and less fatiguing, to
turn Collector. Accordingly in _Yorkshire_ he borrowed an excellent
Gelding, (I make Use of his own Terms) with a hunting Saddle and Bridle,
and with a Case of Pocket Pistols, which he before had, he set out to
seek Adventures, without taking Leave of his Company; he met, he said,
with several Knights Errant, whom as they declined the Combat, he
spoiled and sent to offer themselves at the Feet of his _Dulcinea_, but
being under the Influence of some malicious Enchanter, who envied his
glorious Feats of Arms, and fear'd they would eclipse by the Brightness
of their Lustre, those of some favourite Knight whom he protected; or
otherwise, knowing by his Skill, that he should one Day succumb under
the Weight of his irresistable Arm, by his magical Power, threw him into
a loathsome Dungeon loaded with Irons, whence the wise Man, who had Care
of his Affairs, and was destined to write the History of his heroick
Deeds delivered, and putting him on board a Ship, transported him to the
famous Island of _Jamaica_; and after various Turns of Fortune, link'd
him in Society with these Marine Heroes, the Scourge of Tyrants and
Avarice, and the brave Asserters of Liberty.

This whimsical Fellow made a Play whilst he was on Board, which he
called the _Royal Pyrate_; and this (which to see once would make a
Cynick laugh) was acted on the Quarter-Deck with great Applause, both of
the Actors and Poet; but an Accident which turn'd the Farce into
Tragedy, occasioned an Order of Council to forbid its being play'd a
second Time. The Case was thus; _Alexander_ the Great, environ'd by his
Guards, was examining a Pyrate who was brought before him: The Gunner,
who was drunk, took this to be in earnest, and that his Mess-Mate was in
Danger, and hearing _Alexander_ say,

   _Know'st thou that Death attends thy mighty Crimes,_
   _And thou shall'st hang to Morrow Morn betimes._

Swore by G--d he'd try that, and running into the Gun Room where he left
three Companions over a Bowl of Rum Punch as drunk as himself, told
them, they were going to hang honest _Jack Spinckes_; and if they
suffered it, they should be all hang'd one after another, but by G--d,
they should not hang him, for he'd clear the Decks; and taking a Grenade
with a lighted Match, followed by his Comrades with their Cutlash, he
set Fire to the Fuze and threw it among the Actors. The Audience was on
the Gang Ways and Poop, and falling in with their Cutlash, poor
_Alexander_ had his left Arm cut off, and _Jack Spinckes_ his Leg broke
with the bursting of the Shell: The Ship was immediately in an Uproar,
and the Aggressors seiz'd, who else would have made Havock with the
Guards, or have been cut to Pieces by them, for they had all Cutlashes.
_Alexander_ the Great revenged the Loss of his Arm by the Death of him
who deprived him of his Limb. The Gunner and two surviving Comrades were
that Night clapp'd into Irons, and the next Day at a Court-Marshal, not
only acquitted but applauded for their Zeal. _Alexander_ and his Enemies
were reconciled, and the Play forbad any more to be acted.

A Fortnight after the setting Capt. _Beer_ ashore, _Williams_ boarded
and took a Vessel off _Cape Cod_, laden with Wine; the Crew of which
encreased the Number of their Prisoners: They put seven Men on Board the
Prize, with Orders to keep Company with the Ship and Sloop, commanded by
_Bellamy_ and _Williams_, and left aboard her the Master.

As the Ship and Sloop had been long off the _Carreen_, they stretch'd
away to the Northward, and made the best of their Way to _Penobscott_
River, which lies between _Nova Scotia_ and the Province of _Main_,
where they designed to heave down. This Tract of Land is along the Coast
about 190 Miles from West to East, reckoning from the Province of _Main_
to St. _Croix_; and about 200 Miles over from North to South, counting
from the River _Quebeck_ to the Sea. King _Charles_ the Second made a
Grant of it in 1663, to his Royal Highness _James_ Duke of _York_, who
made a Settlement at _Pemaquid_; it abounds in all Sorts of Timber, and
would bear excellent Hemp and Flax, and all Sorts of Naval Stores; is
rich in Copper, Lead, and Iron Ore; and the Seas are stock'd with
Whales, Cod, Sturgeon, Herrings, Mackrel, Salmon, Oysters, Cockles,
_&c._ the Soil produces all Sort of _European_ Grain and Fruits; and the
Woods shelter a great Number of Deer, as Elks, Red and Fallow Deer,
_&c._ and this Country, if settled, would certainly be of great
Advantage to _England_. I hope the Reader will pardon this small
Digression which the Interest I take in every Thing, which may tend to
the enriching or extending the Dominions of our glorious _Britain_, my
dearly loved Country, forced me into: But to return, when they were at
the Mouth of this River, it was thought more eligible to careen in the
River _Mechisses_; they entered it as agreed, and run up about two Miles
and a half, when they came to an Anchor, with their Prizes. The next
Morning all the Prisoners were set ashore with Drivers, and Orders to
assist in the building Huts; the Guns were also set ashore, and a Breast
Work raised, with Embrazures, for the Canon on each Side the River, this
took up four Days: A Magazine was dug deep in the Earth, and a Roof
rais'd over it by the poor Slaves the Prisoners, whom they treated after
the same Manner as the Negroes are used by the _West-India_ Planters.
The Powder being secured, and every Thing out, they hove down the Sloop,
cleaned her, and when she had all in again, they careened the _Whidaw_,
by the largest Prize. Here the Stroler told the two Commanders, that
they might lay the Foundation of a new Kingdom, which, in time, might
subject the World, and extend its Conquests beyond those of the _Roman_
Empire. I am, it is true, said he, by Birth, the Son of a Miller, but I
have Ambition, Avarice, and Learning enough, to be a Secretary of State,
for I was a Servitor at _Oxford_ before I turn'd Stroler; and if you
think fit to erect this Tract of Land into an Empire, and your joint
Imperial Majesties will employ my Abilities, don't question but I will
prove a true Patriot; that is, by the Figure I will make, I will be a
Credit to your Court, and by the squeezing your Subjects (whom under the
specious Pretence of Liberty, I will keep in abject Slavery) drain such
Sums as shall ever keep them poor, and your and my Treasury full.
_Rome_, the Mistress of the World, was founded by a couple of
Sheep-Stealers, and peopled by run-away Slaves and insolvent Debtors;
how much more advantageously might you two undertake the erecting of a
new Monarchy, whose Subjects are no Strangers to the Art of War, who are
not environ'd as they were with invidious Neighbours, and who may
encrease your Power, and propagate the Species, by taking into your
Protection the _Indians_ of these Parts, and the discontented and
desperate People of the neighbouring _English_ and _French_ Colonies? To
strengthen your selves, raise every useful Man to some Dignity in the
State, and share the Prisoners (I mean such as won't swear Allegiance)
as so many Slaves unworthy of Liberty among your great Men; build more
Vessels, keep them constantly on the Cruize, and force all the Prisoners
either by fair or foul to acknowledge your Sovereignty; it was thus the
greatest Empires of the World were founded; superior Force was always
acknowledged a just Title; and the Ancients ever esteem'd the Prisoners
they made, whose Lives were in their Power by the Law of Arms, lawful
Slaves; and the employing their Lives in the Service of the Conqueror,
but a grateful Retribution for preserving of them. I leave it to the
mature Deliberation of your great Wisdom, whether it is not more
eligible to found here an Empire, and make War by a lawful Authority
derived from your Royal selves, than lie under the opprobrious
Appellations of Robbers, Thieves, profligate Rogues and Pyrates; for
begging Pardon of your Majesties, for that Freedom of Speech, which my
Zeal for your Royal Service, and the publick Good oblige me to; the
World treats you and your loyal Subjects with no softer Terms. But, when
you have once declared your selves lawful Monarchs, and that you have
Strength enough to defend your Title, all the Universities in the World
will declare you have a Right _Jure Divino_; and the Kings and Princes
of the Earth, will send their Ambassadors to court your Alliance.

_Bellamy_ and _Williams_ told him, They would consider on his Proposal,
and they would let him know what they should in their great Wisdom
conclude upon. In the mean while, they thank'd him for his Advice,
promis'd when they began to found their Monarchy, (should they find it
expedient,) to make him Prime Minister, or Quarter-Master ashore; and
when he had enriched himself and Family, by the fleecing their Subjects,
they assured him they would pass an Act of Indemnity for his Security;
and concluded with ordering a Bowl of Punch for every Mess.

The _Whidaw_ being clean'd, they thought of cruizing again, and
accordingly steer'd for _Fortunes Bay_ in _Newfoundland_; they made some
Prizes on the Banks, forced all the Men, and sunk the Vessels.

They had not been long on this Coast before they were separated by a
Storm, which held some Days. Off the Island of St. _Paul_ the _Whidaw_
spied a Sail, which she immediately gave Chase to; the Ship brought to
and lay by for her, she prov'd a _French_ Man of 36 Guns, carrying
Soldiers to _Quebeck_. The _Whidaw_ engag'd with great Resolution, and
the _French_ did not shew less, for he boarded the _Whidaw_, and was
twice put off, with the Loss of Men on both Sides. _Bellamy_ after two
Hours Engagement thought the _Frenchman_ too hard a Match, and was for
shaking him off; but his Enemy was not as willing to part with him, for
he gave Chase, and as he sail'd altogether as well as _Bellamy_, the
latter had certainly been taken and had received the due Punishment of
his Crimes, had not the Night coming on favour'd his Escape: He lost in
this Engagement 36 Hands, beside several wounded, the poor Minister of
State, our before-mentioned Stroller, was in the Number of the slain.

The _Whidaw_ returned to the Coast of _Newfoundland_, and off
_Placentia_ Bay met with his Consort and the Prize.

They resolved to visit again the Coast of _New England_, the _Whidaw_
being much shatter'd in the late Engagement, having receiv'd a great
many Shot in her Hull; they ran down this Coast, and between St.
_George_'s Banks and _Nantuket_'s Shoals, took the _Mary Anne_.

The Master of the Vessel, taken formerly off _Cape Cod_, was left on
board her, and as he was very well acquainted with the Coast, they
order'd him to carry the Light and go a-head; and the Pyrates commonly
kept him at Helm: He upon a Night of publick Rejoicing, seeing all the
Pyrates drunk, laid hold on the Opportunity, and run his Vessel ashore
about Midnight, near the Land of _Eastham_, out of which he alone
escap'd with Life. The _Whidaw_ steering after the Light, met with the
same Fate; the small Vessel ran into a sandy Bay, and the Men got ashore
without Difficulty.

When the _Whidaw_ struck, the Pyrates murder'd all their Prisoners, that
is, all their forced Men; as it is concluded, from the mangled Carcasses
which were wash'd ashore; but not a Soul escaped out of her or
_William_'s, who was also lost.

The Pyrates, to the Number of seven who escaped, were seiz'd by the
Inhabitants, and on the Information of the Master who escap'd, and on
their own Confession, were imprison'd, condemn'd, and executed. They
were all Foreigners, very ignorant and obstinate; but by the
indefatigable Pains of a pious and learned Divine, who constantly
attended them, they were, at length, by the special Grace of God, made
sensible of, and truly penitent, for the enormous Crimes they had been
guilty of. As the Trial of these Pyrates, and their Behaviour while
under Sentence, and at the Place of Execution, was printed at _Boston_,
and is to be had in Town, I shall refer the curious Reader to that small
Tract.


                                   OF
                         Captain _William Fly_,
                             And his CREW.

As to the Birth of this Pyrate, we can discover nothing by the Enquiries
we have hitherto made; and, indeed, had we succeeded in our Search,
could it have been of any great Consequence? For, its certain, by the
Behaviour of the Man, he must have been of very obscure Parents; and, by
his Education, (as he was no Artist) very unfit, in all Respects, except
that of Cruelty, for the villainous Business he was in. We have been
inform'd, that he had been a Pyrate in a private Capacity, and having
escaped Justice, had an Opportunity of repenting his former Crimes, and,
as a foremast Man, or petty Officer, of getting his Bread in a
warrantable Way: But no; ignorant as he was of Letters, he was ambitious
of Power, and capable of the most barbarous Actions to acquire it.

Captain _Green_ of _Bristol_, in _April_ 1726, shipp'd this _Fly_ as
Boatswain, at _Jamaica_, being bound, in the _Elizabeth_ Snow of
_Bristol_, for the Coast of _Guinea_. _Fly_, who had insinuated himself
with some of the Men, whom he found ripe for any Villainy, resolved to
seize the said Snow, and murder the Captain and Mate, and, taking the
Command on himself, turn Pyrate. He proposed this his Design to his
Brothers in Iniquity, who approving it, he, having the Watch at one o'
Clock in the Morning, on the 27th Day of _May_, went up to one _Morrice
Cundon_, then at the Helm, accompanied by _Alexander Mitchel_, _Henry
Hill_, _Samuel Cole_, _Thomas Winthrop_, and other Conspirators, and
swore damn him, if he spoke one Word, or stirr'd either Hand or Foot, he
would blow his Brains out; and, tucking up his Shirt above his Elbow,
with a Cutlass in his Hand, he, with _Mitchel_, went into the Captain's
Cabbin, and told him, he must turn out. The Captain asking what was the
Matter, was answered, by _Mitchel_, they had no Time to answer
impertinent Questions; that if he would turn out, and go upon Deck
quietly, it would save 'em the Trouble of scraping the Cabbin; if he
would not, a few Buckets of Water and a Scraper would take his Blood out
of the Decks. That they had chosen Captain _Fly_ for Commander, and damn
his Blood, they would allow of no other, and would not waste their
Provisions to feed useless Men.

The Captain reply'd, that since they had so resolved he should make no
Resistance; but begged they would not murder him, since his living could
be no Obstacle to their Designs; that he had never been harsh to either
of them, and therefore they could not kill him out of revenge; and if it
was only for their Security, he desired, if they would not take his Word
to do nothing to obstruct the Measures they had resolved on, they would
secure him in Irons till he might be put somewhere on Shore. Ay, G--d
d--mn ye, says _Fly_, to live and hang us, if we are ever taken: No, no,
walk up and be damn'd, that Bite won't take, it has hanged many an
honest Fellow already. _Mitchel_ and _Fly_ then laying hold of him,
pulled him out of his Bed. The poor Captain intreating to spare his
Life, for his Soul's sake, told 'em he would bind himself down by the
most solemn Oaths, never to appear against them; that he was unfit to
appear before the Judgment Seat of a just and pure God; that he was
loaded with Sins, and to take him off before he had washed those Stains
which sullied his Soul by the Tears of Repentance, would be a Cruelty
beyond Comparison greater than that of depriving him of Life, were he
prepared for Death, since it would be, without any Offence committed
against them, dooming him to eternal Misery; however, if they would not
be perswaded that his Life was consistent with their Safety, he begg'd
they would allow him some Time to prepare himself for the great Change.
That he begg'd no other Mercy than what the Justice and Compassion of
the Laws would allow them, should they hereafter be taken. _D--n your
Blood_, said Mitchel, _no Preaching. Be damn'd an you will, what's that
to us? Let him look out who has the Watch. Upon Deck, you Dog, for we
shall lose no more Time about you._

They hawl'd him into the Steerage, and forc'd him upon Deck, where one
of the Hell-Hounds asked if he had rather take a Leap like a brave
Fellow, or be to toss'd over like a sneaking Rascal. The Captain,
addressing himself to _Fly_, said, _Boatswain, for God's sake don't
throw me overboard, if you do, I am for ever lost; Hell's the Portion of
my Crimes_.--Damn him answer'd _Fly_, since he's so devilish godly,
we'll give him Time to say his Prayers, and I'll be Parson. Say after
me. _Lord, have Mercy on me._ Short Prayers are best, so no more Words,
and over with him, my Lads.

The Captain still cry'd for Mercy, and begg'd an Hour's respite only,
but all in vain; he was seized by the Villains, and thrown over Board;
catch'd however, and hung by the Main-Sheet, which _Winthorp_ seeing,
fetch'd the Cooper's broad Ax, and chopping off the unhappy Master's
Hand, he was swallowed up by the Sea.

The Captain being thus dispatched, _Thomas Jenkins_, the Mate, was
secured and brought upon Deck, to share the same cruel Fate. His
Intreaties were as useless as the Captain's; the Sentence they had
passed upon him was not to be reversed; they were deaf to his Prayers
and Remonstrances, Strangers to Humanity and Compassion. He was of the
Captain's Mess, they said, and they should e'en drink together; it was
Pity to part good Company.

Thus they jested with his Agonies; he, however, made some Struggle,
which irritating his Murderers, one of them snatched up the Ax, with
which _Winthorp_ had lopped off the Captain's Hand, and gave him a great
Cut on the Shoulder, by missing his Head, where the Blow was aimed, and
he was thrown into the Sea. He swam notwithstanding, and called out to
the Doctor to throw him a Rope, who, poor Man, could not hear him, being
secured, and laid in Irons in his own Cabin; and had he heard, and been
able to have thrown the Rope required, could it be expected that these
harden'd Wretches would have relented, and shewn him Mercy? But the
sinking Man will catch at a Straw, and Hope, they say, is the last that
deserts us. While we have Life we are apt to flatter our selves, some
lucky Accident may favour us.

It was next debated what should be done with the Doctor. Some were for
sending him to look after the Captain and Mate, but the Majority, as he
was a useful Man, thought it better to keep him. All obstacles being
removed, _Mitchel_ saluted _Fly_ Captain, and, with the rest of the Crew
who had been in the Conspiracy, with some Ceremony, gave him Possession
of the great Cabin.

Here a Bowl of Punch being made, _Morice Cundon_ was called down, and
one _John Fitzherbert_ set to the Helm in his Place. At the same Time
the Carpenter and _Thomas Streaton_ were brought before the Captain, who
told them they were three Rascals, and richly deserved to be sent after
the Captain and Mate, but that they were willing to shew them Mercy, and
not put them to Death in cold Blood, and he would therefore only put
them in Irons, for the Security of the Ship's Crew; they were
accordingly ordered out, and iron'd. _Fly_ then told his Comrades it was
convenient to resolve on some Course, when Word was brought them, that a
Ship was very near them. The Council broke up, and made a clear Ship,
when, in a very little while after, they found it was the _Pompey_,
which had left _Jamaica_ in Company with the Snow; the _Pompey_ standing
for the Snow, which did not make from her, soon haled, and asked how
Captain _Green_ did, and was answered by _Fly_, that he was very well.
They did not think fit to attack this Ship, but returning to hold their
Consultation, it was resolved to steer for _North Carolina_.

Upon their Arrival on that Coast they spied a Sloop at Anchor within the
_Bar_; she was call'd the _John_ and _Hannah_, and commanded by Captain
_Fulker_, who thinking the Snow might want a Pilot stepp'd into his Boat
with his Mate, Mr. _Atkinson_, and Mr. _Roan_, two Passengers, and a
young Lad, in order to bring her in. When they came on board, they were
told, that the _Snow_ was come with a Cargoe from _Jamaica_; Captain
_Fulker_ and Mr. _Roan_ were desired to walk down to the Captain, who
was in the Cabbin; _Fly_ received them very civilly, ordered a Bowl of
Punch, and hearing Captain _Fulker_ had brought another Passenger on
Board, Mr. _Atkinson_ was also invited down.

The Punch being brought in, Captain _Fly_ told his Guest, that he was no
Man to mince Matters; that he and his Comrades were Gentlemen of
Fortune, and should make bold to try if Captain _Fulker_'s Sloop was a
better Sailor than the _Snow_, if she was, she would prove much fitter
for their Business, and they must have her: The _Snow_ came to an Anchor
about a League off the Sloop, and _Fly_ ordered _Fulker_, with six of
his own Hands, into the Boat, to bring her alongside of the _Snow_; but
the Wind proving contrary, their Endeavours proved also vain, and they
returned again in the Boat, bringing Captain _Fulker_ back with them.

As soon as they came on board the _Snow_, _Fly_ fell into a violent
Passion, cursing and damning _Fulker_ for not bringing off the Sloop; he
gave him his Reason, and said, it was impossible. _Damn ye_, replied the
Pyrate, _you lie you Dog, but d--n my B--d, your Hide shall pay for your
Roguery, and if I can't bring her off I'll burn her where she lies_. He
then order'd Captain _Fulker_ to the Geers; no Reason, no Arguments,
could prevail; he was stripp'd and lash'd after a very inhuman Manner:
And the Boat's Crew being sent again, with much ado carried her off as
far as the Barr, where she bilged and sunk. The Pyrates then endeavoured
to set what remained of her out of Water on Fire, but they could not
burn her.

The _Snow_ getting under Sail to look out for some Booty, _Fulker_ and
the others desired they might be set at Liberty, but it was denied them
for the present, tho' not without a Promise that they should be released
the first Vessel they took.

The fifth of _June_ they left _Carolina_, and the next Day they spied a
Sail, which prov'd the _John_ and _Betty_, commanded by Capt. _Gale_,
bound from _Barbadoes_ to _Guiney_. _Fly_ gave Chase, but finding the
Ship wronged him, he made a Signal of Distress, hoisting his Jack at the
main Top-Mast Head; but this Decoy did not hinder the Ship making the
best of her Way. _Fly_ continued the Chace all Night, and the Wind
slackening, he came within Shot of the Ship, and fir'd several Guns at
her under his black Ensign; the Ship being of no Force, and the Pyrates
ready to board, the Captain struck; and _Fly_ manning his Long-Boat,
which carried a Pateraro in the Bow, the Crew being well armed with
Pistols and Cutlashes went on Board the Prize, and sent Capt. _Gale_,
after having secured his Men, Prisoner on board the _Snow_.

This Prize was of little Value to the Pyrates, who took nothing but some
Sail-Cloaths and small Arms, and after two Days let her go, but took
away six of his Men, setting on board Capt. _Fulker_ and a Passenger
(Mr. _Atkinson_ was detained) and Capt. _Green_'s Surgeon; they kept
this Gentleman, Mr. _Atkinson_, knowing he was a good Artist, and lately
Master of the _Boneta_ Brigantine, as a Pilot for the Coast of _New
England_, which they were satisfied he was well acquainted with.

Upon Mr. _Atkinson_'s desiring to have his Liberty with the others,
Captain _Fly_ made him the following Speech: Look ye, Captain
_Atkinson_, it is not that we care a T--d for your Company, G--d d--n
ye; G--d d--n my Soul, not a T--d by G--d, and that's fair; but G--d
d--n ye, and G--d's B--d and W--ds, if you don't act like an honest Man
G--d d--n ye, and offer to play us any Rogues Tricks by G--d, and G--d
sink me, but I'll blow your Brains out; G--d d--n me, if I don't. Now,
Capt. _Atkinson_, you may do as you please, you may be a Son of a Whore
and pilot us wrong, which, G--d d--n ye, would be a rascally Trick by
G--d, because you would betray Men who trust in you; but, by the eternal
J--s, you shan't live to see us hang'd. I don't love many Words, G--d
d--n ye, if you have a Mind to be well used you shall, G--d's B--d; but
if you will be a Villain and betray your Trust, may G--d strike me dead,
and may I drink a Bowl of Brimstone and Fire with the D--l, if I don't
send you head-long to H--ll, G--d d--n me; and so there needs no more
Arguments by G--d, for I've told you my Mind, and here's all the Ships
Crew for Witnesses, that if I do blow your Brains out, you may blame no
Body but your self, G--d d--n ye.

Mr. _Atkinson_ answered, it was very hard he should be forced to take
upon him the Pilotage, when he did not pretend to know the Coast, and
that his Life should answer for any Mistake his Ignorance of the Coast
might make him guilty of, and therefore begg'd he might be set on board
Capt. _Gale_; and that they would trust to their own Knowledge, since he
did not doubt there being better Artists on Board. No, No, replied
_Fly_, that won't do by G--d, your palavring won't save your Bacon.
_Muchas palabras no valen nada_, as the _Spaniards_ say; so either
discharge your Trust like an honest Man, for go you shan't by G--d, or
I'll send you with my Service to the D--l; so no more Words, G--d d--n
ye.

There was no Reply made, and they stood for the Coast of _New England_;
off _Delaware_'s Bay they made a Sloop, commanded by one _Harris_, bound
from _New York_ to _Pensilvania_: She had on Board about fifty
Passengers; _Fly_ gave Chase, and coming up with her, hoisted his black
Ensign, and ordered her to strike, which she immediately did; and _Fly_
sent Capt. _Atkinson_ on Board with three of his Hands, to sail her,
tho' he would not allow him, (_Atkinson_) any Arms: They, the Pyrates,
ransack'd this Prize, but not finding her of any Use to them, after a
Detention of 24 Hours, they let her go, with her Men, excepting only a
well made young Fellow, whose Name was _James Benbrooke_, whom they
kept.

_Fly_, after having releas'd the Prize, ordered Captain _Atkinson_ to
carry the _Snow_ into _Martha_'s Vineyard, but, he willfully miss'd this
Place. _Fly_ finding himself beyond _Nantuckets_, and that his Design
was baulk'd, called to _Atkinson_, and told him, _he was a rascally Son
of an envenom'd Bitch, and d--n his Blood it was a Piece of Cruelty to
let such a Son of a Whore live, who design'd the Death of so many honest
Fellows_. _Atkinson_, in his Defence said, he never pretended to know
the Coast, and that it was very hard he should die for being thought an
abler Man than he really was; had he pretended to be their Pilot, and
did not know his Business, he deserved Punishment; but when he was
forc'd upon a Business which he before declared he did not understand,
it would be certainly cruel to make him suffer for their Mistake.--_G--d
d--n ye_, replied _Fly_, _you are an obstinate Villain, and your Design
is to hang us; but, B--d and W--ds you Dog, you shan't live to see it_,
and saying this, he ran into his Cabbin and fetch'd a Pistol with Design
to shoot _Atkinson_; but by the Interposition of _Mitchell_, who thought
him innocent of any Design, he escaped.

_Atkinson_, who perceived his Life every Minute in Danger, began to
ingratiate himself with the Pyrates, and gave them Hopes, that with good
and gentle Usage, he might be brought to join them; this he did not say
in express Terms, but by Words he now and then let drop, as by Accident:
They were not a little rejoiced at the View of having so good an Artist
to join them; nay, some of them hinted to him, that if he would take
upon him the Command, they were ready to dispossess Capt. _Fly_, who
carried his Command too high, and was known to all the Crew to be no
Artist, and to understand nothing beyond the Business of a Boatswain.
_Atkinson_ thought it his Interest to keep them in the Opinion that he
would join; but always declined hearing any Thing as to the Command.

This made him less severely us'd, and protected him from the Insults of
_Fly_, who imagined he would betray them the first Opportunity, and
therefore more than once proposed his being thrown over Board, which was
never approved by the _Snow_'s Company.

From _Nantuket_ they stood to the Eastward, and off _Brown_'s _Bank_
made a Fishing Schooner. _Fly_ coming up with her fired a Gun, and
hoisting his black Ensign, swore, _d--n his Blood, if they did not
instantly bring to, and send their Boat on Board, he would sink her_:
The Schooner obeyed, and sent away her Boat on Board the _Snow_; he
examined the Captain what Vessels were to be met with, and promised, if
he could put him in the Way of meeting with a good Sailor, to let him
go, and give him his Vessel, or he should otherwise keep her: The poor
Man told him, he had a Companion which would soon be in Sight, and was a
much better Vessel; accordingly about 12 at Noon the same Day, which was
the 23d of _June_, the other Schooner hove in Sight; upon which, _Fly_
mann'd this Prize with six Pyrates, and a Prisoner nam'd _George
Tasker_, and sent her in Chase, having himself on Board the _Snow_, no
more than three Pyrates, Captain _Atkinson_, (who had work'd himself
into some Favour with him) and fifteen forced Men; but he took Care to
have his Arms upon Deck by him.

The Men who had not taken on with _Fly_, were, _Atkinson_, Capt.
_Fulker_'s Mate, and two Youths belonging to him; the Carpenter and
Gunner belonging formerly to Captain _Green_; six of Captain _Gate_'s
Men, and the aforesaid _Benbrooke_, who belonged to Captain _Harris_,
with three of the Men out of the Schooner. _Atkinson_ seeing the
Prisoners and forced Men were five to one of the Pyrates, thought of
delivering himself from the Bondage he was in; and, as by good Luck,
several other Fishing Vessels hove in Sight, right a-head of the _Snow_,
he call'd to Captain _Fly_, and told him, he spied several other Vessels
a-head, desiring, he would come forward and bring his Glass; _Fly_ did
so, and leaving his Arms on the Quarter-Deck, sat him on the Windlass to
see if he could make what they were. _Atkinson_, who had concerted his
Measures, with one _Walker_ and the above-mention'd _Benbrooke_, secured
the Arms on the Quarter-Deck, and gave them a Signal to seize _Fly_,
which they did, with very little Trouble, and after made themselves
Masters of the other three Pyrates and the _Snow_; the rest of the
Prisoners, not knowing any Thing of, or what the Design might be,
remaining altogether inactive, and brought the _Snow_ and Pyrates to
_Great Brewster_, where a Guard was put on Board _June_ 28, 1726.

Soon after, the said Pyrates were brought to their Trial, that is, on
the fourth of _July_ following, before the Honourable _William Dummer_,
Esq; Lieutenant Governor and Commander in chief, of the Province of
_Massachuset_'s Bay, President of the special Court of _Admiralty_, held
at the Court-house of _Boston_, assisted by 18 Gentlemen of the Council,
before whom they were found guilty of Murder and Pyracy, condemn'd to be
executed, and accordingly were executed the 12th of _July_; _Fly_ was
order'd to be hang'd in Chains at the Entrance of the Harbour of
_Boston_. Thus ended the short Reign of an obdurate Wretch, who only
wanted Skill and Power to be as infamous as any who had scoured the
Seas; the Names of the three Pyrates, executed with him, were _Samuel
Cole_, _George Condick_ and _Henry Greenvill_.


                                   OF
                         Capt. _Thomas Howard_,
                             And his CREW.

We have said in another Life, _viz._ _White_'s, that he was a Lighterman
on the River _Thames_, his Father was of the Business, and had the
Character of a very honest Man. After his Father's Decease, he grew very
extravagant, and squander'd away not only what he had left his Son, but
what he had allotted for his Widow Mother to our Adventurer, whose
Indulgence putting every Thing into her Son's Hands, was follow'd by
being her self turn'd out of Doors, for he sold the House over her Head.
After having ruin'd himself and Mother, his Friends fearing the
Wickedness of his Inclinations would bring a Scandal upon them,
persuaded him to go to Sea, and procur'd him a Voyage to _Jamaica_, on
board a Merchant Ship. At this Island he ran away from his Ship, and
associating himself with some desperate Fellows, they stole a Canoe, and
went away to the grand _Camanas_ to join some others of their own Stamp,
who lurked thereabouts, with Design to go on the _Account_, the Term for
Pyrating: They met those they look'd for, made up a Company of 20 Men,
surprized and made themselves Masters of a Turtling Sloop, and set out
in Search of Booty.

The first Prizes they made were only Turtlers, which, however, encreas'd
the Number of their Crew, some being willing to join them, others being
forced, with Threats of being set ashore on some desolate Key.

They after some Time cruizing met with an _Irish_ Brigantine, who had
Provisions and Servants on board. They made an Exchange with the Master,
gave him Provision to carry him to _Jamaica_, and allow'd five Hands to
go with him; the rest (except the Servants, who readily took on with the
Pyrates) were all forced.

Not long after, they surprized a Sloop which had been trading on the
_Spanish_ Coast; as she had 6 Guns, and was a fit Vessel for their Turn,
they chang'd her against the Brigantine; several Hands belonging to this
Sloop enter'd Voluntiers, and several more were obliged to join them by
Compulsion.

After this Capture, they steer'd for the Coast of _Virginia_, and, in
their Way, met with a large _New England_ Brigantine, laden with
Provisions, bound for _Barbadoes_. This they made Prize of; and shifting
their own Guns on board her, sent the Master away in the Sloop; after
forcing some of his Men with them. They had now a Vessel of 10 Guns, and
a Crew of 80 Men, of whom one _James_ was Captain, and _Howard_
Quarter-Master.

While they lay on the Coast of _Virginia_, they made Prize of several
Ships from _England_, out of which they took Men, Liquors, Provisions,
Cloaths, and whatever else they either liked or thought necessary. As
these Ships had several Felons on board, who were Transports, they had
out of them a Number of Voluntiers, beside forced Men; so that they had
a large Complement. Among other _Virginia_ Ships which fell into their
Hands, they made Prize, with little Trouble, of a fine Galley, mounted
with 24 Guns, which afforded them a great many Voluntiers, as she had a
Number of transported Malefactors and Servants on board. They changed
their Brigantine for this Ship, and soon after, the Man of War, which
waited on this Coast, heaving in Sight, they thought proper to take
their Departure.

From the Coast of _Virginia_, they shap'd their Course for that of
_Guiney_, where they took a great many Ships of different Nations, all
which they rifled of what they thought fit: Out of these Ships they
forced on board a Number of Men, equal to the Number of those formerly
compell'd, who desired, and whom they permitted, to be discharged, after
much Entreaty.

After they had been some Months on the Coast, they spied a large three
deck'd _Portuguese_ Ship from _Brazil_, mounted with 36 Guns; they gave
Chase and came up with her: The Captain would make no Resistance, but
his Mate, who was an _Englishman_, named _Rutland_, thinking it Shame to
give up such a Ship, resolved to defend her; which the _Portuguese_
Captain consented to, but went himself out of Harm's Way. _Rutland_, who
had been Master of an _English_ Brigantine, taken from him on the same
Coast by another Gang of Pyrates, fought them the better Part of a
Forenoon; but the _Portuguese_ flying the Decks, and only thirty Men,
who were _English_, _Dutch_, and _French_, standing by him, he was
obliged to ask Quarters, which were given. When the Pyrates came on
board, they asked _Rutland_, if he was Commander? he answer'd, No. They
enquired after him, and being told, he was somewhere in the Hold, they
search'd, and found him hid in the Powder-Room; whence they hawled him
up, and whipp'd him round the Deck for his Cowardice. _Rutland_, and
those who fought the Ship, they forced on board, and their Complement
being now 180 Men, they exchanged their Galley for the _Portuguese_
Ship, carried her in Shore, and ripping off her upper Deck, made her
deep wasted, and much snugger, by cutting down some of her Gunnel. This
Prize they named the _Alexander_.

They went down the Coast in this Ship, and made several Prizes, some of
which they discharged, and put on board such of their forced Men as
begg'd their Discharge; others, they sunk, and burnt others; but forced
on board all Carpenters, Cawlkers, Armorers, Surgeons, and Musicians. In
their Way to _Cape Lopez_, where they designed, and afterwards did
clean, they found a large _Bristol_ Ship at an Anchor, which had lost a
great many Men by Sickness, and had then but few healthy on board, who
got into the Boat, and endeavoured to get to Shore, but were prevented
by the Pyrates: Here they changed some more of their forced Men, and did
intend to change their Ship; but on a Survey, found the _Bristol_ Man
too old for their Purpose, and therefore left her at an Anchor, after
they had taken what they thought of Use to them; this Ship belong'd to
one Mr. _Godly_ of _Bristol_.

They met with nothing else in their Way to _Cape Lopez_, where they
clean'd their Ship, took in Wood and Water, and then stood away to Sea
again.

At their leaving _Cape Lopez_, they spied an _English_ Ship, which they
came up with and engaged; the Merchant Man made an obstinate Defence,
and finding the Design to board, made to close Quarters. _Howard_ and
seven or eight more entered, but the Pyrate's Boatswain not having
secured his lashing, they fell a-stern, and left these Men on board the
Merchant-Ship, who seeing themselves in Danger, hawl'd up the Boat,
which the Chace had a-stern, and, cutting the Rope, got on board the
_Alexander_, which being considerably the larger Ship, and drawing a
great deal more Water, stuck on an unknown Bank, which the Merchant Man
went over, and by this lucky Accident escaped.

This obliged the Pyrates to start their Water, and throw over the Wood
to get the Ship off, which put 'em under a Necessity of going back to
_Cape Lopez_ to take in those Necessaries. After having a second time
wooded and water'd, they put again to Sea, fell in with and took two
_Portuguese_ Brigantines, which they burnt, and setting the Men on
Shoar, they made for, and doubled the Cape of _Good Hope_, and shap'd
their Course for _Madagascar_, where to the Northward of, and forty Mile
from, the Bay of _Augustine_, and near a small Island, they run the Ship
on a Reef, where she stuck fast. The Captain being then sick in his Bed,
the Men went ashoar on the small adjacent Island, and carried off a
great deal of Provision and Water to lighten the Ship, on board of which
none but the Captain, the Quarter-Master, and about eleven more were
left.

The Quarter-Master, who was _Howard_, with the others, took all the
Treasure, and put it on board the Boats, made off for the Main of
_Madagascar_; the Captain, hearing no Body stir upon Deck, made shift to
crawl out of his Cabbin, and seeing 'em put off, fir'd the two fore
chace Guns at 'em, which alarm'd (to no Purpose) the Men ashoar; as the
Sea ebb'd, the Ship lay dry, and they could walk to her from the Island.
She might have been saved had they had the Boats to carry out an Anchor;
but for want of them they brought every Thing ashoar, at Tide of Flood,
upon Rafts. As the Ship lay in a quiet Place, they had Opportunity to
rip her up, and build a Vessel out of her Wreck. The major Part of the
Crew being _English_ and _Dutch_, who sided together, they forced about
36 _Portuguese_ and _French_ (thinking the Crew too numerous for their
Provisions in their present Circumstances) to get upon a Raft, and take
their Chance with the Sea-Breeze to get to the Island of _Madagascar_,
about 3 Leagues from them. They finish'd a Vessel of 60 Tuns, but the
Day they design'd to have launch'd her, a Pyrate Brigantine hove in
Sight, who took 'em on board.

_Howard_ and his Consorts stood along the West-Side of the Island, with
Design to round the North End, and to go to St. _Mary_'s, but finding
the Current too strong to stem, they lay there about a Fortnight; in the
Interim they spied three Sail of tall Ships, which were Men of War under
Commadore _Littleton_, (_viz._ the _Anglesea_, _Hastings_ and _Lizard_,)
who had carried a Pardon to the Island of St. _Mary_, accepted of by
many of the Pyrates. Thinking these might be also Pyrates, they made a
Smoak, which brought the Boats ashoar; but finding they were Men of
War's Boats, the Pyrates thought fit to abscond, wherefore finding
nothing, nor any Body, the said Men of War's Boats return'd, and the
Ships kept their Cruise.

They had here plenty of Fish and wild Hogs, which they found in the
Wood. One Day, when _Howard_ was Hunting, his Comrades took the
Opportunity, went off, rounded the North End, and left Mr. _Howard_ to
provide for himself.

About four or five and twenty Leagues from the Cape, they went into a
fine Harbour on the East Side, not frequented nay, hardly known to the
_European_ Ships. They were here received handsomely, treated and
provided with fresh Meat, and what Necessaries they wanted, by the King
of this District, whose Name was _Mushmango_, who had formerly been
driven from _Augustine_ by War, and travelling thro' the Heart of the
Country, had here fixed his Settlement. When the Boats were victualled,
and while _Johnson_, who took on him the Command after they had deserted
_Howard_, was ashoar with three more, the rest went off with the Boats
and Booty, and stood away to the Southward, along the Coast, designing
for St. _Mary_'s, going every Night into some Harbour, or coming to an
Anchor under some Point when the Winds proved contrary.

_Johnson_ addressed himself to the King, and told him the Boat and Goods
were his Property; upon which he went along Shore with a Number of Men,
and found the Boat at an Anchor, and all asleep, except one to look out,
at whom the King fired his Blunderbuss, and kill'd him; the Report of
the Piece awaken'd the others, who cut and stood off the Coast. The King
return'd, gave _Johnson_ an Account of his Expedition, and furnish'd him
a Canoe, some Calabashes of fresh Water, Provisions and Launces, that he
might pursue after his People.

_Johnson_ kept the Shoar on Board till he came to the Island of St.
_Mary_'s, where he heard his Comrade Fugitives were gone to, and settled
at _Ambonavoula_, in a Village belonging to the Natives on the River of
_Manansallang_; leaving his Canoe, he went into one belonging to an
Inhabitant, who carried him to his Companions.

After he had been here some few Months _Fourgette_, already mention'd in
_White_'s Life, came in with his Ship from _Martinico_: With this Vessel
they sail'd to the West-Side, and came to an Anchor at an Island called
_Anquawla_, 30 Leagues from the Place where they left _Howard_.

Some of the Subjects of the King of _Anquawla_ had before met with, and
brought hither, Captain _Howard_, who seeing the Ship at an Anchor near
Shore, haled her, and desired the Boat might be sent to fetch him off,
which was accordingly done, and he joined the rest of the Crew.

Here two Boys ran away from them, whom they demanded of the King; but he
not delivering them, they went ashore by Day-Break, surpriz'd his Town,
and brought off 12 of his Concubines, whom they detain'd on board, till
their Boys, who were Blacks, were returned, and then delivered them
back. From this Ship he went on board the _Speaker_, where he continued
till she was lost on _Mauritius_, when he came back to _Madagascar_, and
settled at _Augustine_, here he staid till the _Prosperous_, a Ship of
36 Guns, commanded by Captain _Hilliard_, came in; which _Howard_ and
some other Pyrates, (with the Assistance of the Boatswain and some of
the Crew belonging to the Ship) seized. In the taking of this Ship, the
Captain and his chief Mate were killed, and several others wounded.
_Howard_ was by the Company declared Captain.

Several of the Ship's Crew took on with them, and they went round the
South End to the East Side, till they came the Length of _Maritan_,
where they found some of the _Speaker_'s Company, whom they took on
board, and made up their Complement about 70 Men.

From hence they steer'd for the Island of St. _Mary_, where they heel'd
their Ship, water'd, wooded, and shipp'd some more Hands: Here they had
an Invitation from one _Ort Van Tyle_, who liv'd on the Main of
_Madagascar_, to come to the Ceremony of christening two of his
Children; they were kindly received and treated by him, but it having
been reported, that this _Ort Van Tyle_ had murdered some Pyrates, they
in Revenge, tho' they had no Certainty of the Fact, took him Prisoner,
plunder'd his House, and what Goods they could not take off in a great
Canoe belonging to him, they threw into the River or burnt. _Ort Van
Tyle_ they design'd to carry on board, and hang at a Yard Arm, but one
of the Pyrates help'd him to escape, and he took into the Woods, where
meeting some of his Blacks, he way-laid his Canoe, and _Howard_'s
Pinnace by the River Side; besides what Goods they had on board of this
_Dutchman_'s, they had several Women and Children belonging to him, and
some white Men, who had left them under his Care. The Pyrates set the
Women to the Paddles, and the Canoe was over-set on the Bar; _Ort Van
Tyle_ fired on the Men, and shot one thro' the Arm and thro' the Thigh,
whom with his Comrade, he took Prisoner, and kept with him: The rest of
the Men got ashore on the South-Side the River and escaped him; the
Women on the North-Side, and returned home. When the _Pinnace_ came
down, he fir'd and shot the Captain thro' the Arm, but he got on board,
where his Arm was set. After this, the _Prosperous_ sail'd for
_Methelage_, where they victualled, with a Design to go to the
_East-Indies_; while he lay here, came in a large _Dutch_ Ship, well
mann'd, and of 40 Guns; the _Prosperous_ was not strong enough to attack
her, and the _Dutch_ fearing he should spoil his Trade, would not meddle
with Captain _Howard_, tho' hard Words pass'd, and the _Dutchmen_
threatned to fall foul on him if he did not leave the Place, which
_Howard_ thought fit to do, and sail'd to _Mayotta_.

Few Days after the Departure of the _Prosperous_, Captain _Bowen_, in
the _Scotch_ Ship, came in, anchored within small Arm-Shot, and right
a-head of the _Dutchman_, whom he saluted with 11 Guns Shot and all,
which the other returned, with 15 after the same Manner; Drums beating,
and Trumpets sounding, on both Sides. The _Dutchman_, however, was
surprized, and under Apprehensions; he hal'd the Pyrate, and answer was
return'd, _From the Seas_; he then bid 'em send their Boat on Board,
which accordingly went with the Quarter-Master, who told the Captain,
that they had no Design on him, but were going against the _Moors_, and
came in for Provision; he replied, they could get none there, and the
best Way was to be gone; however the Quarter-Master went ashore (where
the _Dutch_ had made his Factory, and had some Goods) and shot down
three Oxen, which he ordered the Natives to help to cut in Pieces; the
_Dutchman_ perceiving a Friendship between the Natives and Pyrates,
seeing _Bowen_ full of Men, and hearing two more Pyrates were expected,
thought fit to go off in the Night, and leave the Goods he had put on
shore.

Few Days after _Bowen_ seizing the Goods left, went for _Mayotta_, where
he join'd the _Prosperous_, and lay for the Season to go to the
_East-Indies_. After some Stay here, their Salt Provisions perishing,
they return'd to _Madagascar_ to revictual, _Bowen_ to St. _Augustin_'s,
and _Howard_ (on board of whose Ship was Captain _Whaley_, taken as is
said in _Bowen_'s Life) to _Methelage_, agreeing to meet at the Island
of St. _John_'s, to lie for the _Moors_ Fleet; where, after some
Disappoints, they met, and got Sight of the _Moors_ Fleet, one of which
fell a Prize to _Bowen_; but the _Prosperous_ being a heavy Sailor, did
not come up with them till they were at an Anchor at the Bar of _Surat_,
where they waited to lighten. The _Moors_, seeing few Hands on board,
for _Howard_ concealed his Men; and not imagining a Pyrate would venture
up, they concluded him an _English East-India_ Man: _Howard_ clapp'd the
largest on board, which stood him a smart Engagement, and killed him
about 30 Men. At length the Pyrates forced Captain _Whaley_, who spoke
the _Moors_ Language, to go on board and offer Quarter, which they
accepted: There was on board this Prize a Nobleman belonging to the
Great _Mogul_, who had been at _Juffa_ to buy Horses for his Master; the
Prize yielded them a great Booty, tho' they found but Part of the Money
which was on board. They intended to carry her to _Madagascar_, but her
Bowsprit being wounded in the boarding, she lost all her Masts,
wherefore, they set her a-drift, and she ran ashore at _Deman_,
belonging to the _Portuguese_.

From hence he steer'd to the _Malabar_ Coast, where he met _Bowen_ in
his Prize, which mounted 56 Guns; here a Dispute arose, as shall be
mention'd in the Appendix of _Bowen_'s Life, both Crews went on board
_Bowen_, sunk the _Prosperous_, and burnt the _Scotch_ Ship, called the
_Speedy Return_: Hence they stood along the Coast of _India_, and
_Howard_, with about 20 more, landed with what they had, and retired
among the Natives, where _Howard_ married a Woman of the Country, and
being a morose ill natur'd Fellow, and using her ill, he was murder'd by
her Relations.


                                   OF
                            Captain _LEWIS_.
                             And his CREW.

This worthy Gentleman was an early Pyrate; we first find him a Boy on
Board the Pyrate _Banister_, who was hang'd at the Yard Arm of a Man of
War in sight of _Port-Royal_ in _Jamaica_. This _Lewis_ and another Boy
were taken with him, and brought into the Island hanging by the Middle
at the Mizzen-Peak. He had a great Aptitude for Languages, and spoke
perfectly well that of the _Mosquill Indians_, the _French_, _Spanish_
and _English_. I mention our own, because it is doubted whether he was
_French_ or _English_, for we cannot trace him back to his Original.

He sailed out of _Jamaica_ till he was a lusty Lad, and was then taken
by the _Spaniards_ at the _Havana_, where he staid some Time; but at
length he and six more ran away with a small Canoe, and surprized a
_Spanish_ Periagua, out of which two Men joined them, so that they were
now nine in Company: With this Periagua they suprized a Turtleing Sloop,
and forced some of the Hands to take on with them, the others they sent
away in the Periagua.

He play'd at this small Game, surprising and taking Coasters and
Turtlers, till with forced Men and Voluntiers he made up a Complement of
40 Men.

With these he took a large Pink built Ship, bound from _Jamaica_ to the
Bay of _Campeachy_, and after her several others bound to the said Bay;
and having Intelligence that there lay in the Bay a fine _Bermudas_
built Brigantine of 10 Guns, commanded by Captain _Tucker_; he sent the
Captain of the Pink to him with a Letter, the Purport of which was, that
he wanted such a Brigantine, and if he would part with her, he would pay
him honestly 10000 Pieces of Eight; if he refused this, he would take
Care to lie in his Way, for he was resolved, either by fair or foul
Means, to have the Vessel. Captain _Tucker_ having read the Letter, sent
for the Masters of Vessels then lying in the Bay, and told them, after
he had shewn the Letter, that if they would made him up 54 Men (for
there were about 10 _Bermudas_ Sloops) he would go out and fight the
Pyrates. They said, No, they would not hazard their Men, they depended
on their Sailing, and every one must take Care of himself as well as he
could.

However, they all put to Sea together, and spied a Sail under the Land,
which had a Breeze while they lay becalmed; some said he was a Turtler,
others, the Pyrate, and so it proved; for it was honest Captain _Lewis_,
who putting out his Oars, got in among them. Some of the Sloops had four
Guns, some two, some none. _Joseph Dill_ had two, which he brought on
one Side, and fired smartly at the Pyrate, but unfortunately one of them
split, and killed him three Men. _Tucker_ called to all the Sloops to
send him Men, and he would fight _Lewis_, but to no Purpose; no Body
came on board him. In the mean while a Breeze sprung up, and _Tucker_
trimming his Sails left them, who all fell a Prey to the Pyrate; into
whom however he fired a Broadside at going off. One Sloop, whose Master
I won't Name, was a very good Sailer, and was going off; but _Lewis_
firing a Shot at him, brought her to, and he lay by till all the Sloops
were visited and secured. Then _Lewis_ sent on board him, and ordered
the Master into his Sloop. As soon as he was aboard, he asked the Reason
of his lying by, and betraying the Trust his Owners had reposed in him,
which was doing like a Knave and Coward, and he would punish him
accordingly; for, he said, you might have got off, being so much a
better Sailer than my Vessel. After this Speech he fell upon him with a
Rope's End, and then snatching up his Cane, drove him about the Decks
without Mercy. The Master, thinking to pacify him, told him he had been
out trading in that Sloop several Months, and had on board a good
Quantity of Money, which was hid, and which, if he would send on board a
Black belonging to the Owners, he would discover it to him.

This had not the desired Effect, but one quite contrary; for _Lewis_
told him he was a Rascal and Villain for this Discovery, and, by G--d,
he would pay him for betraying his Owners, and redoubled his Strokes.
However, he sent and took the Money and Negroe, who was an able Sailor.
He took out of his Prizes what he had occasion for, 40 able Negroe
Sailors, and a white Carpenter; the largest Sloop, which was about 90
Tuns, he took for his own Use, and mounted her with 12 Guns; his Crew
was now about 80 Men, Whites and Blacks.

After these Captures he cruised in the Gulf of _Florida_, lying in wait
for the _West-India_ homeward bound Ships which took the Leeward
Passage, several of which falling into his Hands were plundered by him,
and released; from hence he went to the Coast of _Carolina_, where he
cleaned his Sloop, and a great many Men, whom he had forced, ran away
from him; however, the Natives traded with him for Rum and Sugar, and
brought him all he wanted, without the Government's having any Knowledge
of him, for he had got into a very private Creek; tho' he was very much
on his Guard, that he might not be surprized from the Shoar.

From _Carolina_ he cruized on the Coast of _Virginia_, where he took and
plunder'd several Merchant Men, and forced several Men, and then
return'd to the Coast of _Carolina_, where he did abundance of Mischief.

As he had now abundance of _French_ on board who had entered with him,
and _Lewis_ hearing the _English_ had a Design to Maroon them, he
secured the Men he suspected, and put them in a Boat, with all the other
_English_, 10 Leagues from Shoar, with only 10 Pieces of Beef, and sent
them away, keeping none but _French_ and Negroes; these Men, it is
supposed, all perished in the Sea.

From the Coast of _Carolina_ he shaped his Course for the Banks of
_Newfoundland_, where he overhawled several Fishing Vessels, and then
went into a commodious Harbour, where he cleaned his Sloop, and went
into _Trinity Harbour_ in _Conception Bay_, where there lay several
Merchants, and siezed a 24 Gun Galley, called the _Herman_: The
Commander, Captain _Beal_, told _Lewis_, if he would send his
Quarter-Master ashoar he would furnish him with Necessaries. He being
sent ashoar, a Council was held among the Masters, the Consequence of
which was, the seizing the Quarter-Master, whom they carried to Captain
_Woodes Rogers_; he chained him to a Sheet Anchor which was ashoar, and
planted Guns at the Point, to prevent the Pyrate getting out, but to
little Purpose; for the People from one of these Points firing too soon,
_Lewis_ quitted the Ship, and, by the Help of Oars and the Favour of the
Night, got out in his Sloop, though she received many Shot in her Hull.
The last Shot that was fired at the Pyrate did him considerable Damage.

He lay off and on the Harbour, swearing he would have his
Quarter-Master, and intercepted two fishing Shallops, on board of one
was the Captain of the Galley's Brother; he detained them, and sent
Word, if his Quarter-Master did not immediately come off, he would put
all his Prisoners to Death; he was sent on board him without Hesitation.
_Lewis_ and the Crew enquired, how he had been used? and he answered,
very civilly. Its well, said the Pyrate; for had you been ill treated, I
would have put all these Rascals to the Sword. They were dismiss'd, and
the Captain's Brother going over the Side, the Quarter-Master stopp'd
him, saying, he must drink the Gentlemens Health ashoar, in particular
Captain _Rogers_', and, whispering him in the Ear, told him, if the Crew
had known of his being chain'd all Night, he would have been cut in
Pieces, with all his Men. After this poor Man and his Shallop's Company
were gone, the Quarter-Master told the Usage he had met with, which
enraged _Lewis_, and made him reproach his Quarter-Master, whose Answer
was, that he did not think it just the Innocent should suffer for the
Guilty.

The Masters of the Merchant Men sent to Captain _Tudor Trevor_, who lay
at St. _John_'s in the _Sheerness_ Man of War; he immediately got under
Sail, and miss'd the Pyrate but four Hours.

She kept along the Coast, and made several Prizes, _French_ and
_English_, and put into a Harbour where a _French_ Ship lay making Fish:
She was built at the latter End of the War for a Privateer, was an
excellent Sailer, and mounted 24 Guns. The Commander haled him; the
Pyrate answered, from _Jamaica_ with Rum and Sugar. The _French_ Man bid
him go about his Business; that a Pyrate Sloop was on the Coast, and he
might be the Rogue; if he did not immediately sheer off he would fire a
Broadside into him. He went off and lay a Fortnight out at Sea, so far
as not to be descry'd from Shoar, with Resolution to have the Ship. The
_French_ Man being on his Guard, in the mean while raised a Battery on
the Shoar, which commanded the Harbour. After a Fortnight, when he was
thought to be gone off, he return'd, and took two of the fishing
Shallops belonging to the _French_ Man, and manning them with Pyrates,
they went in; one Shallop attack'd the Battery, the other surpriz'd,
boarded, and carry'd the Ship, just as the Morning Star appear'd, for
which Reason he gave her that Name. In the Engagement the Owner's Son
was kill'd, who made the Voyage out of Curiosity only. The Ship being
taken, 7 Guns were fired, which was the Signal, and the Sloop came down
and lay a Long-side the Ship. The Captain told him, he suppos'd he only
wanted his Liquor; but _Lewis_ made Answer, he wanted his Ship, and
accordingly hoisted all his Ammunition and Provision into her. When the
_French_ Man saw they would take away his Ship, he sold her Trim, and
_Lewis_ gave him the Sloop; and, excepting what he took for Provision,
all the Fish he had made. Several of the _French_ took on with him, who,
with others, _English_ and _French_, had by Force or voluntarily, made
him up 200 Men.

From _Newfoundland_ he steer'd for the Coast of _Guiney_, where he took
a great many Ships, _English_, _Dutch_, and _Portuguese_; among these
Ships was one belonging to _Carolina_, commanded by Captain _Smith_.
While he was in Chace of this Vessel an Accident happen'd, which made
his Men believe he dealt with the Devil; for he carried away his Fore
and Main-Top Mast; and he, _Lewis_, running up the Shrouds to the
Main-Top, tore off a Handful of Hair, and throwing it into the Air, used
this Expression, _Good Devil take this till I come_: And, it was
observed, that he came afterwards faster up with the Chace than before
the Loss of his Top-Masts.

_Smith_ being taken, _Lewis_ used him very civilly, and gave him as
much, or more in Value, than he took from him, and let him go, saying,
he would come to _Carolina_ when he had made Money on the Coast, and
would rely on his Friendship.

They kept some Time on the Coast, when they quarrell'd among themselves,
the _French_ and _English_, of which the former was more numerous, and
they resolved to part: The _French_ therefore chose a large Sloop newly
taken, thinking the Ship's Bottom, which was not Sheath'd, damaged by
the Worms.

According to this Agreement they took on board what Ammunition and
Provision they thought fit out of the Ship, and put off, chusing one _le
Barre_ Captain. As it blew hard, and the Decks were encumbered, they
came to an Anchor under the Coast, to stow away their Ammunition, Goods,
_&c._ _Lewis_ told his Men, they were a Parcel of Rogues, and he would
make 'em refund; accordingly run a Long-side his Guns, being all loaded
and new primed, and ordered him to cut away his Mast, or he would sink
him. _Le Barre_ was obliged to obey. Then he ordered them all ashoar;
they begged to have Liberty of carrying their Arms, Goods, _&c._ with
'em, but he allow'd 'em only their small Arms, and Cartridge Boxes. Then
he brought the Sloop a Long-side, put every Thing on board the Ship, and
sunk the Sloop.

_Le Barre_ and the rest begg'd to be taken on board; however, though he
denied 'em, he suffered _le Barre_ and some few to come, with whom he
and his Men drank plentifully. The Negroes on board _Lewis_ told him,
the _French_ had a Plot against him. He answer'd, he could not withstand
his Destiny; for the Devil told him in the great Cabin, he should be
murdered that Night.

In the dead of Night came the rest of the _French_ on board in Canoes,
got into the Cabbin and killed _Lewis_; they fell on the Crew, but,
after an Hour and Half's Dispute, the _French_ were beat off, and the
Quarter-Master, _John Cornelius_, an _Irish_ Man, succeeded _Lewis_.


                                   OF
                          Captain _Cornelius_,
                             And his CREW.

Having now the Command of the _Morning Star_, _Cornelius_ kept on the
Coast, and made several Prizes both _English_ and _Portuguese_; the
former he always discharged, after he had taken what he thought fitting,
but the latter he commonly burnt.

While he was thus ravaging the Coast, two _English_ Ships which had
slaved at _Whydah_, one of 36 Guns, and the other of 12, which fought
close, were ready to sail; and having Notice of a Pyrate, who had done
great Mischief, resolved to keep Company together for their Defence. The
Captain of the small Ship lay sick in his Cabbin, and she was left to
the Care of the Mates. When they had got under Sail, 200 Negroes jump'd
over board from the larger Ships, which obliged her to bring to and get
out her Boats; the Mate of the other went into the Cabbin, told the
Accident, and advised lying by, and sending their Boats to assist their
Consort; but the Captain being ill, and willing to get off the Coast,
bid him keep on his Way, for it would be dangerous, having 400 Slaves on
board, and being but weakly mann'd, when the Boats were gone they might
rise upon him. The Mate urged the Danger of the Pyrates, should they
leave their Consort. The Captain answered, the Seas were wide, and he
would not bring to; accordingly they kept on their Way with a fresh
Gale.

Two Days after, the Mate about Eight in the Morning, ordered a Man to
the Mast-head, who spied a Sail, which made them prepare for an
Engagement. There was on board one _Joseph Williams_, who had served the
_African_ Company three Years on the _Guiney_ Coast, who spoke the
Negroe Tongue very well; he told the Slaves he had pick'd out to the
Number of 50, that the Ship in Sight he believed would fight them, and
if they got the better, would certainly, as they were Cannibals, kill
and eat them all, and therefore it behoved them to fight for their
Lives; they had Lances and small Arms given them.

About Ten _Cornelius_ came up with them, and being haled, answered, he
was a Man of War, in Search of Pyrates, and bid them send their Boat on
board; but they refusing to trust him, tho' he had _English_ Colours and
Pendent aboard, the Pyrate fired a Broadside, and they began a running
Fight of about 10 Hours, in which Time the Negroes discharged their Arms
so smartly, that _Cornelius_ never durst attempt to board. About 8 at
Night the Ship blew up abaft, they immediately cut the Lashings of the
Long-Boat, but the Ship going down they had not Time to get her out, and
barely enough to launch the Yawl, which lay on the Forecastle. The Ship
went down on one Side, and _Joseph Williams_ running on the other was
hook'd by the Mizzen-Truss, and was carried down with her; but having
his Knife in his Hand, and a great Presence of Mind, he cut the
Wast-band of his Trowzers where he was catch'd, got clear, and swam
after the Boat, into which about 16 had gotten, and either knock'd those
on the Head, or cut off their Hands, who laid hold on it; however, with
much Entreaty, he was permitted to lay one Hand on to ease him: They
made to the Pyrate, who refused to receive them, without they would
enter with him, which, to save their Lives, they all agreed to, and was
then civilly received, and dry Cloaths given them; these and one Negroe
were all the Souls saved.

In a little Time after this he took two _Portuguese_ Ships, which he
plundered and kept with him; and one foggy Morning hearing the firing of
Guns, which, by the distance of Time, he judg'd to be Minute Guns, as
they really were, for the Death of an _English_ Commander; he called his
Men on board from the Prizes, sent them about their Business, and
directed his Course by the Report of the Canon he had heard.

In about two Hours he spied the Ship that had fired, came up with her
very soon, and took her without Resistance. The Officers of the Ship
which blew up, finding this Prize _English_, and that the Pyrate did not
intend to detain it, begg'd to be discharged, as they had all large
Families, which must perish without their Support.

_Cornelius_ taking them into Consideration, discharged Mr. _Powis_ of
_Limehouse_, who has since been a Commander, and raised a Fortune; the
then chief Mate, Mr. _George Forelong_, the Boatswain, Carpenter, and
other married Men, set them on board the Prize, and was very generous to
them out of the Plunder of the _Portuguese_ Ships, because they had made
a broken Voyage; but _Joseph Williams_ and the Batchelors he detained,
and forced some out of the Prize, which he let go.

After this he took three _Portuguese_ Ships at an Anchor, which he
plundered and burnt, after he had hove down by one of them; he continued
some Time longer on the Coast, did a great Deal of Mischief to the
Trade, and forced a great many Men: These he put to do all the Slavery
of the Ship, and they were beat about the Decks, without daring to
strike again. I shall take Notice of an Instance of this Kind, to shew
how far Revenge will carry a Man. One _Robert Bland_ was at Helm, and
called _Joseph Williams_ to take the Whipstaff, till he went to play,
_Williams_ refused it; upon which _Bland_ drubb'd him with the Lanyard
of the Whipstaff very severely, _Williams_ that he might revenge
himself, and have Liberty to fight _Bland_, went that Instant and
entered himself a Voluntier in the Ships Books, and ask'd Leave to fight
_Bland_, which was allowed him, but with no other Weapons than his
Fists; he, however, challenged his Antagonist, who was too hard for him;
so that he turned Pyrate to be heartily thresh'd.

_Cornelius_ thinking they had been long enough on the _Guiney_ Coast,
doubled the Cape, off which he spied the _Lizard_ and two more Men of
War, under the Command of Commadore _Littleton_; _Cornelius_ was for
giving Chase, but finding his Men unwilling, there being, as they gave
for Reason, 70 forc'd Men on board, and these Ships being, as they
suspected, Men of War, he made the best of his Way for _Madagascar_,
went up the River _Methelage_, on the West Side, and anchored against
_Pombotoque_, a small Village of Blacks.

The Quarter-Master went ashore, and the black Governor examined him, for
several of these Blacks speak _English_; he told the Governor they were
come for Provision and to trade: Upon which he sent a Couple of Oxen on
board, and then ordered some of the Inhabitants to go up with the
Quarter-Master to the King. The Boat's Crew seeing a Number of Blacks
come upon the Strand without the Quarter-Master, apprehended some
Mischief had befallen him; but were eas'd of their Fears, when they saw
two Oxen given them, and were told, the white Man, who was gone to the
King, would be back next Day, it not being above 20 Miles from the
Shore.

When the Quarter-Master, who carried up a Blunderbuss, a fine Gun, and a
Pair of Pistols, for a Present to the King, told him they wanted
Provisions, he asked where they were bound? To which he answered, to
seek their Fortunes, for, at present, they were very poor. Look ye,
replied the King, I require nothing of you, all white Men I look upon as
my Children; they help'd me to conquer this Country, and all the Cattle
in it is at their Service. I will send you down Provisions enough, and
when that is spent you shall have more; he accordingly sent 1000 Head of
Cattle, out of which he bid them chuse what they would, and they salted
up a 100 fat Oxen.

It may be an Amusement to the Reader to have a short History of this
King, who was called _Andian Chimenatto_, that is, King _Chimenatto_: He
was 2d Son of _Andian Lifouchy_, whose Country lay between _Methelage_
and St. _Augustine_, his elder Brother was _Timanangarivo_.

At the Death of _Andian Lyfouchy_, _Chimenatto_, assisted by a younger
Brother, and a great Number of the People, endeavour'd to wrest the
Kingdom from his elder Brother _Timanangarivo_; but he was defeated, and
with his Party obliged to retire, however, he still made War upon his
Brother, till he was, by repeated Losses, very much weaken'd, and
apprehensive of being attack'd by him; he retir'd farther Northward,
where he made War on _Andian Methelage_, but without great Success, so
that he settled on a Point of Land by the Sea-Coast, where the
_Tyloutes_, that is, Inhabitants of the Sea, who are descended from the
_Arabs_, and the _Vaujimbos_, who are esteem'd the meanest Cast on the
whole Island, were very vexatious and troublesome to him, and kept him
in continual Alarms.

In the mean while a couple of Ships arrived at _Yungowl_ (the Country of
_Timanangarivo_) belonging to _Frederick Phillips_, of _New York_, to
slave; but hearing the old King was dead, who had a great Respect for
the Whites, and that _Timanangarivo_ had cut off the Crew of a
Brigantine, on Pretence that they had poison'd his Father _Andian
Lyfouchy_, for he drunk on board her so much Brandy that he died of it;
they would not stay here, but went farther on the Coast to look for
Trade.

_Andian Chimenatto_ spying them, caused a Smoak to be made, which
brought one of their Boats on Shoar; _Chimenatto_ received the Crew very
civilly, and invited the Ships in, promising Trade.

The Commanders ask'd if he had Slaves? He said he had but few; however,
if they would allow some of their Men to go with him to War, he would
slave both Ships: They answered, that _Timanangarivo_ his Brother, had
murder'd some of their Countrymen, and they could put no Confidence in
him; upon which he gave them the History of his Wars, said his Brother
was a wicked Man for what he had done; but if they would send some Men
with him, he would give his Wives and nearest Relations for Hostages, to
be kept on board.

This was agreed to, and _Chimenatto_ furnished them with as much fresh
Provision as they could dispose of; twenty Whites went with him to War,
and they took a Town and a great Number of Slaves, out of whom he
ordered the Captain to pick and cull what they pleas'd; they asked the
Price, he said, he required nothing, if they would let their Men go out
once more. They went on a second Expedition, took several Towns, and
brought down some thousand Slaves, beside great Droves of Cattle.

The two Ships took their Choice of about 6000 Slaves, which with fresh
Provision, and Provision for their Voyage, cost them only 2 or 3 Barrels
of Powder, and a few Arms.

The King told them, if they would leave those Men and come again, he
would again slave them for nothing; the Men being willing to stay, the
Ships sail'd, came again the next Season, were slaved according to
Promise, and relieved those whites, such of them as would return, and
left others, who were willing, in their Steads. With this Assistance
_Chimenatto_ soon conquered the _Antylouts_ and _Vaujimbos_, and
afterwards made himself Master of the whole Country of _Methelage_, of
such Reputation are the _Europeans_ among these People, for they who
have a white Man on their Side go on as to certain Victory; and the
Sight of a white Man against them is such a Damp to their Spirits, that
despairing of Success, they are preparing for Flight before they engage.

But to return, besides the Present of Oxen, the King sent 100 Blacks
laden with Rice. _Cornelius_ sent him a Present of 2 Barrels of Powder,
and would have given him more, with small Arms in Return, but he sent
them Word he would have no more, nor any of their Arms, not being in
Want of either; on the contrary, if they wanted he would send them ten
Barrels of Powder, as they were his Children; bid them proceed on their
Voyage, and if they were richer when they came back, and would send him
any Present, he would accept it, but not now that they were poor.

Here _Cornelius_ lost 70 Men by their Excesses, having been long without
fresh Provision, the eating immoderately, drinking Toke (a Liquor made
of Honey) to Excess, and being too free with the Women, they fell into
violent Fevers, which carried them off.

The Blacks having given _Cornelius_ an Account of the _Speaker_'s being
sail'd from _Methelage_ about three Months before for the _East-Indies_,
he, having taken in his Provisions, steer'd the same Course, in Hopes to
join in Consort with her; but the _Speaker_ lying off the _Red Sea_, and
the _Morning Star_ going into the Gulf of _Persia_ they never met: They
run up a pretty Way in the Gulf, and lay under _Antelope_ Island, where
they kept a Look-out, and whence they made their Excursions, and took a
Number of Prizes.

Here they designed to heave down and clean, and they had got a good Part
of their Goods and Water Casks ashore, when the Look-out discovered two
tall Ships, one of them wearing a Flag at the Foretop-Mast Head; this
put them into a great Confusion, they got what Casks and Necessaries
they could on board, and lay till the Ships came a-breast of them; then
they got under Sail at once, their Sails being furl'd with Rope Yarns,
and came close along-side the larger Ship, which was a _Portuguese_ of
70 Guns, as the other was of 26; they exchanged a Broadside with her,
and the smaller Ship engaged her so close, that they threw Hand Grenades
into each other; but _Cornelius_'s Business was to run, and the great
Ship put a Stays twice to follow him, but missing, was obliged to Ware,
which gave the Pyrate a great Advantage; the small Ship in staying,
tail'd aground, she, however, gave Chase till she had run a good Way
a-head of her Consort, which the Pyrate seeing, brought to, and stay'd
for her, as did the _Portuguese_ for her Consort, not caring to engage
him singly. When it was quite dark _Cornelius_ ran up the other Shore,
pass'd the _Portuguese_ Ships (which kept down the Gulf) and came again
to Anchor at his old Station, where he found his Enemies had been ashore
in their Boats and staved his Casks; he here cleaned, and finding no
Money to be got out of any Prizes made, and Bale Goods being of little
Value to them, they from hence went away to the Island of _Johanna_,
where it was designed to moroon the Blacks, who were the greater Number,
and all bred among the _English_; _Joseph Williams_, fearing they would
next moroon the _English_, who were not above a third of the whites,
gave the Negroes Notice of the Design, who secured all the Arms of the
Ship, and gave _Williams_ the Command till they should get to
_Madagascar_, keeping a good Guard on the _French_ and _Dutch_. When
they came to _Methelage_ they gave the Ship to the King, her Bottom
being eaten so much with the Worms, that she was no longer fit for
Service; and they all went and lived with the new King _Chimave_, Son to
_Andian Chimenatto_, who died before their Return: About five Months
after they broke up, _Cornelius_ died, and was buried with the usual
Ceremony.


                                   OF
                        Capt. _David Williams_,
                             And his CREW.

This Man was born in _Wales_, of very poor Parents, who bred him up to
the Plough and the following of Sheep, the only Things he had any Notion
of till he went to Sea. He was never esteem'd among the Pyrates as a Man
of good natural Parts, perhaps, on account of his Ignorance of Letters,
for, as he had no Education, he knew as little of the sailing a Ship,
set aside the Business of a foremast Man, as he did of History, in
which, and natural Philosophy, he was equally vers'd: He was of a
morose, sour, unsociable Temper, very cholerick, and easily resented as
an Affront what as brave and a more knowing Man would not think worth
Notice; but he was not cruel, neither did he turn Pyrate from a wicked
or avaritious Inclination, but by Necessity, and we may say, tho' he was
no forced Man, he could not well avoid that Life he fell into.

When he was grown a lusty Lad he would see the World, and go seek his
Fortune, as the Term is among the Country Youths, who think fit to
withdraw themselves from the Subjection of their Parents; with this Whim
in his Head he got to _Chester_, where he was received, and sailed on
board a Coaster, till he had made himself acquainted with the Rigging,
learned to knot, splice, and do the other Parts of a common Sailor's
Duty; then coming to _London_, he shipp'd himself on board the _Mary
India_ Man, bound for _Bengal_ and _Maderas_, which Voyage he performed
outward, and it was not his Fault that he did not come home in the same
Ship; for, in her Return, falling short of Water, they steer'd for the
Island of _Madagascar_, and fell in with the East Side, in the Lat. of
20, or thereabouts. The Captain mann'd and sent ashore the Long-Boat to
seek for Water, but a large Surf running, she came to an Anchor, at some
little Distance from Shore, and _David Williams_ with another, being
both good Swimmers, stripp'd and swam off in Search of Water: While they
were ashore, the Wind which blew full upon the Island and freshning, the
Surf ran too high for them to get off; and the Long-Boat, after waiting
some time, seeing no Possibility of getting these Men on board, weigh'd
and stood for the Ship, which filled her Sails and stood for St.
_Augustine_'s Bay, where she watered and proceeded on her Voyage.

Thus our poor _Welshman_ and his Companion were left destitute on an
Island altogether unknown to them, without Cloaths or Subsistance, but
what the Fruits of the Trees offer'd. They rambled some little Time
along the Coast, and were met with by the Natives, and by them carried
up into the Country, where they were humanly treated, and provided with
all the Necessaries of Life, tho' this was not sufficient to expel his
Consort's Melancholy, who took his being left behind so much to Heart,
that he sicken'd and died in a very little Time.

Some time after, the Prince of the Country, who entertained _Williams_,
had a Quarrel with a neighbouring King, which broke into a War.
_Williams_ took the Field with his Patron, but the Enemy being superior
in Number, got the Victory, and took a great many Prisoners, among whom
was the unfortunate _Welshman_: The King, whose Prisoner he was, treated
him very kindly; and being Master of an old Musket, gave it him, saying,
'such Arms were better in the Hands of a white Man than in those of any
of his Subjects, who were not so much used to them; that he should be
his Friend and Companion, and should fare as well as himself, if he
would assist him in his Wars.'

It will not be amiss here to take Notice, that this Island, on the East
Side, is divided into a great Number of Principalities or Kingdoms,
which are almost in continual War one with another; the Grounds of which
are very trivial, for they will pick a Quarrel with a Neighbour,
especially, if he has a Number of Cattle (in which, and Slaves, consist
their Riches) on the slightest Occasion, that they may have an
Opportunity of Plunder; and when a Battle or two is lost, the conquer'd
makes his Peace, by delivering up such a certain Number of Bullocks and
Slaves as shall be demanded by the victorious Prince. On the West Side
of the Island, the Principalities are mostly reduced under one Prince,
who resides near _Methelage_, and who is, as we have said in the Lives
of other Pyrates, a great Friend to white Men; for his Father, who
founded his Empire by the Assistance of the _Europeans_, left it in
Charge with his Son, to assist them with what Necessaries they should
require, and do them all friendly Offices; but if he disobeyed this
Command, and should ever fall out with the white Men, or spill any of
their Blood, he threaten'd to come again, turn him out of his Kingdom,
and give it to his younger Brother. These Menaces had a very great
Effect upon him, for he firmly believed his Father would, on his
Disobedience, put them in Execution; for there is not on Earth, a Race
of Men equally superstitious.

But to return to _Williams_, he lived with this Prince in great
Tranquility, and was very much esteem'd by him (for Necessity taught him
Complaisance) after some time, his new Patron was informed, that his
vanquish'd Enemy had form'd a grand Alliance, in order to make War upon
him; wherefore, he resolved to begin, and march into the Countries of
the Allies, and ravage the nearest before they could join their Forces.
He rais'd an Army, and accordingly march'd Southward; at the News of his
Approach, the Inhabitants abandoned all the small Towns, and sending
Messengers to their Friends, rais'd a considerable Body to oppose him,
suffering him to over-run a great Deal of Ground without Molestation. At
length being reinforced, they took their Opportunity, and setting upon
him when his Men were fatigued, and his Army incumber'd with Booty, they
gained a signal Victory; the King had the good Luck to get off, but
_Williams_ was a second Time taken Prisoner.

He was carried before the Conqueror, who, (having been an Eye-witness of
his Bravery, for _Williams_ kill'd a Number of his Enemies with his
Shot, and behav'd very well, defending himself with the Butt End of his
Musket for some Time, when he was surrounded) reach'd him his Hand, and
told him, he made War with his Enemies only, that he did not esteem the
White Men such, but should be glad of their Friendship.

Here _Williams_ was used with more Respect than he had been even by his
last Patron, and lived with this Prince some Years; but a War breaking
out, he was routed in a set Battle, in which _Williams_ was his
Companion; in the Pursuit the poor _Welshman_ finding he could not get
off, clapp'd his Musket at the Foot of a Tree, and climbing up, he
capitulated: He was now terribly afraid of being cut to Pieces, for he
had shot and wounded a great Number of the Enemy; they, however,
promis'd him good Quarter, and kept their Word.

The King of _Maratan_, who took him, used him as well as any of the
former had done; and carried him always with him to the Wars, in which
Fortune was more propitious, for the Parties _Williams_ commanded had
constantly the better of their Enemies, and never returned but with
great Booties of Cattle and Slaves, for all the Prisoners they take are
so, till redeem'd; tho' these Prisoners are, for the most part, Women
and Children, they seldom giving Quarter to any other.

The Fame of his Bravery and Success, spread it self round the Country;
and his Name alone was so terrible, that the giving out he was at the
Head of any Party, was giving the Enemies an Overthrow without a Battle.

This reaching the Ears of _Dempaino_, a mighty Prince who lived 200
Miles from him, and who had several Petty Princes Tributaries, he sent
an Embassador to demand the White Man; but his Patron, who had no Mind
to part with him, denied that he had any White Man with him, that he who
was called so was a Native of the Country. For the Readers better
understanding this Passage, I must inform him, that there is a Race of
what they call White Men, who have been settled on _Madagascar_, Time
out of Mind, and are descended from the _Arabs_; but mixing with the
Negroes, have propagated a Race of Molattoes, who differ in nothing from
the Manner of living of the Black Natives.

To proceed, the Embassador desired to see this Man, and _Williams_
coming to him, being extremely tann'd, he had pass'd for what he was
reported, had he been before apprized of what had been said, to have
answered accordingly, for he spoke the Language perfectly; or had the
Embassador not examined him; who, after he had some Time viewed him,
ask'd of what Country he was, and whether it was true that he was one of
_Madagascar_? _Williams_ answered, he was an _Englishman_, and was left
in the Country, relating the Particulars, as I have already set them
down, adding, he had been five Years in the Island.

The Embassador then told the King, that he must send the White Man with
him, for such were the Orders of his Master the great _Dempaino_, who
was Lord over most of the Kings on the Side the Country where he
resided; and that it would be dangerous for him to disobey the Commands
of so great a Monarch.

The King answered, those who were subject to _Dempaino_ ought to obey
his Commands, but for him, he knew no Man greater than himself,
therefore should receive Laws from none; and with this Answer dismiss'd
the Ambassador; who, at his Return, reported to his Master the very
Words, adding, they were delivered in a haughty Strain. _Dempaino_, who
was not used to have his Commands disputed, order'd one of his Generals
to march with 6000 Men, and demand the White Man, and in Case of
Refusal, to denounce War, that he should send him back an Express of it,
and he would follow in Person with an Army to enforce a Compliance.

These Orders were put in Execution with the greatest Dispatch and
Secrecy; so that the Town was invested, before any Advice was given of
the Approach of an Enemy. The General told the King, it was in his
Choice to have Peace or War with his Master, since it depended on the
Delivery of the White Man.

The King thus surpriz'd, was obliged, however contrary to his
Inclinations, to give _Williams_ up to the General, who return'd with
him to _Dempaino_, without committing any Hostilities; tho' he threatned
to besiege the Town, and put all but the Women and Children to the
Sword, if the King of _Maratan_ did not pay the Expence of his Master's
sending for the White Man, which he rated at 100 Slaves, and 500 Head of
Cattle, the King objected to this as a hard Condition and an unjust
Imposition, but was obliged to acquiesce in it.

One Thing, remarkable enough, had like to have slipp'd me; which is, the
King of _Maratan_ sent _Williams_ to the General without any Attendance,
which made him ask, if the White Man was a Slave? The King answered, he
had not used him like one. I may very well, said the General, be of a
contrary Opinion, since you have sent no Body to wait upon him: Upon
which Reprimand, the King sent _Williams_ a Present of a Slave.

He was received by _Dempaino_ with a great many Caresses, was handsomely
cloathed according to the Country Manner, had Slaves allotted to wait on
him, and every Thing that was necessary and convenient; so that King
_Dempaino_ was at the Trouble of sending 6000 Men, one would think, for
no other End than to shew the great Value and Esteem he had for the
_Europeans_. He continued with this Prince till the Arrival of a Ship,
which was some Years after his leaving _Maratan_; when the _Bedford_
Galley, a Pyrate, commanded by _Achen Jones_, a _Welshman_, came on the
Coast, on board of which Ship _Williams_ was permitted to enter; they
went to _Augustine_, where, laying the Ship on Shore, by Carelessness
they broke her Back, and lost her. The Crew lived here till the Arrival
of the _Pelican_, another Pyrate, mentioned in _North_'s Life; some of
them went on board this Ship, and steer'd for the _East-Indies_.
_Williams_ shifted out of this on board the _Mocha_ Frigate, a Pyrate,
commanded by Captain _Culliford_, and made a Voyage; then, returning to
St. _Mary_'s, they shared the Booty they had got in the Red Seas. I
shall not here mention the Particulars of this last Expedition,
designing to write Captain _Culliford_'s Life, which it more properly
belongs to.

Some of the Crew, being _West Indians_, having an Opportunity, returned
home; but _Williams_ remain'd here till the Arrival and taking of Capt.
_Forgette_, which has been already mentioned: He was one of those who
took the _Speaker_, (the Manner has been told before, in another Life)
went a Voyage in her, and returned to _Maratan_, as is said in _North_'s
Life. Here the King seeing him, ask'd what Present he intended to make
him for former Kindness? _Williams_ answered, he had been over paid by
the Prince whom he took him from and by his Services, which Answer so
irritated his _Maratanian_ Majesty, that he ordered him to quit his
Country; and he could hardly after that see him with Patience.

From hence he went on board the _Prosperous_, Captain _Howard_,
Commander, who went to St. _Mary_'s, and thence to the Main, as is said
in that Pyrate's Life, and was one of the Men left behind when they had
a Design to carry off _Ort Van Tyle_. This _Dutchman_ kept him to hard
Labour, as planting Potatoes, _&c._ in revenge for the Destruction and
Havock made in his Plantations by the Crew of the _Prosperous_; he was
here in the Condition of a Slave six Months, at the Expiration of which
Time, he had an Opportunity (and embraced it) to run away, leaving his
Consort, _Tho. Collins_, behind him, who had his Arm broke when he was
taken by the _Dutchman_.

Having made his Escape from a rigid, revengeful Master, he got to a
Black Prince, named _Rebaiharang_, with whom he lived half a Year; he
from hence went and kept Company with one _John Pro_, another
_Dutchman_, who had a small Settlement on Shore, till the Arrival of the
Men of War, commanded by Commodore _Richards_, who took both _Pro_ and
his Guest _Williams_, put them in Irons (on board the _Severn_) till
they came to _Johanna_, where the Captain of the _Severn_ undertook for
2000 Dollars to go against the _Mohilians_, in which Expedition several
of the Man of War's Crew were killed, and the two Pyrates made their
Escape in a small Canoe to _Mohila_, where they shelter'd themselves a
while in the Woods, out of which they got Provisions, and made over for
_Johanna_; here they recruited themselves and went away for _Mayotta_,
an Island 18 Leagues in Length. The King of this Island built them a
Boat, and giving them Provisions and what Necessaries they required,
they made for and arrived at _Madagascar_; where, at _Methelage_, in the
Lat. of 16, 40, or thereabouts, they join'd, as has been said, Captain
_White_.

Here they lay about 3 Months, then setting Fire to their Boat, they went
into _White_'s, and rounding the North End came to _Ambonavoula_; here
_Williams_ staid till Captain _White_ brought the Ship _Hopewell_, on
board of which he entered before the Mast, made a Voyage to the Red
Seas, towards the End of which he was chosen Quarter-Master. At their
Return they touch'd at _Mascarenas_ for Provisions, where almost half
the Company went ashore and took up their Habitations.

From _Mascarenas_ they steer'd for _Hopewell_ (by some call'd
_Hopefull_) Point, on _Madagascar_, where dividing their Plunder, they
settled themselves.

Twelve Months after, the _Charles_ Brigantine, Captain _Halsey_, came
in, as is mentioned in his Life. _Williams_ went on board him and made a
Voyage; at their Return they came to _Maratan_, lived ashore, and
assisted the King in his War against his Brother, which being ended in
the Destruction of the latter, and a Pyrate lying at _Ambonavoula_,
sending his Long-Boat to _Manangcaro_, within ten Leagues of _Maratan_,
_Williams_ and the rest went on board, and in three Months after he had
been at _Ambonavoula_ he was chosen Captain of the _Scotch_ Ship,
mentioned in _Halsey_'s Life.

This Ship he work'd upon with great Earnestness, and made the _Scots_
Prisoners labour hard at the fitting her up for a Voyage; and she was
near ready for the Seas when a Hurricane forced her ashore, and she was
wreck'd.

Some Time after this he set up and finished a Sloop, in which he and ten
of his Men, design'd for _Mascarenas_, but missing the Island they went
round _Madagascar_, to a Place called _Methelage_, where he laid his
Vessel ashore and staid a Year; but the King being tired with his morose
Temper, and he disagreeing with every Body, he was order'd to be gone,
and accordingly fitting up his Vessel he put to Sea, intending to go
round the North End of the Island; but the Wind being at E. S. E. and
the Current setting to N. W. he put back to a Port, called the _Boyne_,
within 10 Leagues of _Methelage_, in the same King's Dominions whom he
had left. The Governor of this Place was descended from the _Arabs_, and
it was here that the _Arabians_ traded.

When he came to an Anchor, he and three of his Men (he had but 5 with
him) went on Shore, paddled by two Negroes. _David Eaton_ and _William
Dawson_, two of the Men, required a Guide, to shew them the Way to the
King's Town; the Governor order'd them one, and, at the same time, laid
an Ambush for them in the Road, and caused them to be murdered. When
they had left the _Boyn_, _Williams_ and _Meyeurs_, a _Frenchman_, who
also came ashore in the Canoe, went to buy some _Samsams_, which are
agate Beads; as they were looking over these Goods, a Number of the
Governor's Men came about them, seiz'd them both, and immediately
dispatch'd _Meyeurs_, _Williams_ they bound, and tortur'd almost a whole
Day, by throwing hot Ashes on his Head and in his Face, and putting
little Boys to beat him with Sticks; he offer'd the Governor 2000
Dollars for his Life, but he answer'd, he'd have both that and the Money
too; and accordingly when he was near expiring, they made an End of him
with their Lances.

After this barbarous Murder, the Governor thought of seizing the Sloop,
on board of which were no more than two White Men, six Negroe Boys, and
some Women Slaves of the same Colour; however, he thought it best to
proceed by Stratagem, and therefore putting a Goat and some Calabashes
of Toke on board _William_'s Canoe, with twelve Negroes arm'd, and the
Sloop Negroes to paddle, he sent to surprize her. When the Canoe came
pretty near the Vessel, they hal'd, and ask'd if they would let them
come aboard? One of the Men ask'd _William_'s Negroes where the Captain
was? He answered, drinking Toke with the Governor, and sent them
Provision and Toke. A Negroe Wench advised the White Man, whose Name was
_William Noakes_, not to let them come on board, for as four White Men
went ashore, and none of them appear'd, she suspected some Treachery;
however, on the Answer made him from the Canoe, he resolved to admit
them, and giving the Wench a Kick, cryed, _D--m ye, must we have no
fresh Provisions for your Whimsies_; he called them on board, and no
sooner were they on Deck but one of them snatching _Noakes_ his Pistol,
shot him thro' the Head, and seizing the other White Man, threw him
over-board and drown'd him; after which, being Masters of the Vessel,
they carried her in and rifled her.

The King was at this Time a hunting, as is his Custom to hunt Boars
three Months in the Year; but the Account of these Murders soon reach'd
him, however, he staid the accustom'd Time of his Diversion; but when he
returned home, and the Whites, who were about him, demanded Justice, he
bid them be quiet, they might depend upon his doing it: He sent to the
Governor of _Boyn_, and told him, he was glad that he had cut off
_Williams_ and his Crew, an Example he was resolved to follow and clear
the Country of them all. That he had some Affairs to communicate to him,
and desired he would come to Court as soon as possible, but take Care he
was not seen by any of the Whites, for fear by his, they shou'd revenge
the Death of their Companions.

The Governor on these Orders came away immediately, and stopp'd two
Miles short, at a little Town two Miles distant from the King's, and
sent Word he there waited for his Commands.

The King ordered him to be with him early next Morning, before the White
Men were out of their Beds; he set forward accordingly the next Day
betimes, but was seiz'd on the Road by Negroes placed for that Purpose,
and brought bound to the King, who, after having reproach'd him with the
Barbarity of his Action, sent him to the White Men, bidding them put him
to what Death they pleased; but they sent Word back, he might dispose of
his Subjects Lives as he thought fit, but for their Part they would
never draw a Drop of Blood of any who belonged to him. Upon which Answer
the King's Uncle ordered him to be speared, and he was accordingly
thrust thro' the Body with Lances. The King, after this Execution, sent
to _Boyn_, and had every Thing brought which had belonged to _Williams_
and his Men, and divided it among the Whites, saying, _He was sorry the
Villain had but one Life to make Attonement for the Barbarity he had
been guilty of_.


                                   OF
                        Capt. _Samuel Burgess_,
                             And his CREW.

Capt. _Samuel Burgess_ was born in _New-York_, and had a good Education;
he was what they call a well-set Man, and bandy legg'd; he sail'd some
Time as a Privateer in the _West-Indies_, and very often, the Gang, he
was with, when the Time of their cruizing was expir'd, would make no
Ceremony of prolonging the Commission by their own Authority.

By his Privateering he got together some little Money, and returned
home, where the Government having no Notice, or, at least, taking none,
of his pyratical Practice, in staying beyond the Date of his Commission:
He went out Mate of a Ship, in the Service of _Frederick Phillips_,
bound to the Island of _Madagascar_, to trade with the Pyrates, where
they had the Misfortune to lose their Ship, and lived eighteen Months at
_Augustine_, when an _English_ Pyrate coming in, the King of the Country
obliged him to go on board her, tho' much against his Inclination, for
he was tired of a roving Life; but their Choice was to go or starve, for
the King would keep them no longer.

He went with this free Booter to the _East Indies_, where they made
several rich Prizes; returned to St. _Mary_'s, where they took in
Provisions, Wood, and Water. Several of their Gang knock'd off here; but
the Captain, _Burgess_, and the Remainder, went away for the _West
Indies_, disposed of their Plunder on the _Spanish_ Coast, and then
returning to _New York_, purposely knocked the Ship on the Head at
_Sandy Hook_, after they had secur'd their Money ashore.

The Government not being inform'd of their Pyracy, they lived here
without Molestation, and, in a short Time, _Burgess_ married a Relation
of Mr. _Phillips_', who built a Ship, called the _Pembroke_, and sent
him a second Time to _Madagascar_. In his Way to this Island, he went
into the River of _Dilagou_ on the _African_ Coast, where he took in a
Quantity of Elephants Teeth; and thence to _Augustine_, where he met
with several of his old Ship Mates, with whom he traded for Money and
Slaves. Leaving this Place he went to _Methelage_, where he also took
some Money and Negroes; and from thence he shaped his Course for St.
_Mary_'s, on the East Side, where he also drove a considerable Trade
with his old Comrades, took several of them Passengers, who paid very
generously for their Passage; and taking with him an Account of what was
proper to bring in another Trip, he return'd to _New York_, without any
sinister Accident: This Voyage clear'd 5,000 l. Ship and Charges paid.

His Owner encouraged by this Success, bid him chuse what Cargoe he
pleas'd, and set out again; accordingly he laded with Wine, Beer, _&c._
and returning to _Madagascar_ arrived at _Maratan_ on the East Side,
where he disposed of a great Part of his Cargoe at his own Rates. At
_Methelage_ he disposed of the rest, and return'd, clearing for himself
and Owner 10,000 l. besides 300 Slaves he brought to _New York_.

After a short Stay at home, he set out again on the old Voyage, fell in
first with _Methelage_, where he victualled and traded; from thence he
went round the South End, touch'd and sold Part of his Cargoe at a large
Profit, to his old Acquaintance. He made a trading Voyage round the
Island, and at St. _Mary_'s met another Ship belonging to his Owner,
which had Order to follow his Directions; he stay'd at this Port till he
had disposed of the Cargoe of both Ships; he then shaped his Course
homewards, with about 20 Pyrates Passengers, who had accepted the Pardon
brought by Commadore _Littleton_.

In his Way he touch'd at the _Cape_ of _Good Hope_, for Wood, Water, and
fresh Provision: While he was here, the _Loyal Cook_, an _East India_
Man came in, who made Prize of _Burgess_, and carried him to the _East
Indies_; he there would have delivered _Burgess_'s Ship to the Governor
of _Maderass_, but the Governor would have no Hand in the Affair, and
told the Captain, he must answer to the _East-India_ Company and
_Burgess_'s Owner for what he had done.

Most of the Pyrate's Passengers thought themselves clear'd by the Act of
Grace; but some of them, not willing to trust to it, got off with what
Gold they could, in a _Dutch_ Boat; they who trusted to the Pardon were
clapp'd in Goal, and died in their Irons. I cannot omit the Simplicity
of one of them, who had, however, the Wit to get off: When he designed
to go away, he look'd for his Comrade for the Key of his Chest, to take
his Gold with him, which amounted to Seventeen hundred Pounds; but this
Comrade being ashore, he would not break open Chest, for it was Pity, he
said, to spoil a good new Lock, so left his Money for the Captain of the
_East-India_ Man.

The News of this Capture came to the Owner before the Ship return'd, and
he sued the Company; but, at their Request, staid for the Arrival of the
_Loyal Cook_, which brought _Burgess_ Prisoner to _England_ soon after.
The Captain finding himself in an Error, and that what he had done could
not be justified, absconded; the Company made good the Ship and Cargo to
the Owner. _Burgess_ was set at Liberty, continued some Time in
_London_, was impeach'd, and Pyracy sworn against him by _Culliford_
(mentioned in _Williams_'s Life) who notwithstanding, he came home on
the Act of Grace, was clapp'd into _Newgate_, tried and acquitted, tho'
he was beggar'd.

_Burgess_'s Owner stickled very hard for him, and expended great Sums of
Money to save him; however, tho' he pleaded the Necessity of his going
on board the Pyrate, (as his Life shews it) he was tried and condemn'd;
but by the Intercession of the Bishops of _London_ and _Canterbury_, was
pardon'd by the Queen.

After this, he made a broken Voyage to the _South Sea_, Lieutenant to a
Privateer, and returning to _London_, was out of Business a whole Year.

He then shipp'd himself Mate on board the _Hannah_, afterwards called
the _Neptune_, and went to _Scotland_ to take in her Cargo, the Owner
being of that Nation; but before she got thither he the Owner broke, and
the Ship was stopp'd, and lay 18 Months before she was dispos'd of: But
being set to Sale, and six _Scotch_ Gentlemen buying her, the old
Officers were continued, and she proceeded on her first designed Voyage
to _Madagascar_, in which the Captain and _Burgess_ quarrelling, was the
Loss of the Ship; for the latter, who was acquainted with the Pyrates,
when they arrived at _Madagascar_, spirited them up to surprize her: The
Manner how, being already set down in _Halsey_'s Life, I need not
repeat.

I shall only take Notice, that Captain _Miller_ being decoy'd ashore,
under Pretence of being shew'd some Trees, fit for Masting, _Halsey_
invited him to a Surloin of Beef, and a Bowl of Arrack Punch; he
accepted the Invitation, with about 20 of the Pyrates. One _Emmy_, who
had been a Waterman on the _Thames_, did not come to Table, but sat by,
muffled up in a great Coat, pretending he was attack'd by the Ague, tho'
he had put it on to conceal his Pistols only. After Dinner, when
_Halsey_ went out, as for something to entertain his Guests, (_Miller_
and his Supercargo,) _Emmy_ clapp'd a Pistol to the Captain's Breast,
and told him, he was his Prisoner; at the same Instant, two other
Pyrates enter'd the Room, with each a Blunderbuss in his Hand, and told
the Captain and his Supercargoe, that no Harm should come to either, if
they did not bring it upon themselves by an useless Resistance. While
this past within Doors, the Wood being lined with Pyrates, all
_Miller_'s Men, whom he had brought ashore to fell Timber, were secur'd,
but none hurt, and all civilly treated. When they had afterwards got
Possession of the Ship, in the Manner mention'd before, they set all
their Prisoners at Liberty.

_Miller_, with eleven of his Men, was sent off, as is said in _Halsey_'s
Life: The Company chose _Burgess_ Quarter-Master, and shar'd the Booty
they had made out of the _Scotch_ Ship, and the _Greyhound_.

Soon after happen'd _Halsey_'s Death, who left _Burgess_ Executor in
Trust for his Widow and Children, with a considerable Legacy for
himself, and the other Pyrates grumbling at a new Comer's being
preferr'd to all of them, took from _Burgess_ 3,000 l. of _Halsey_'s
Money, and 1200 l. of his own, which was his Share of the two Prizes.
Tho' he had been treated in this Manner, they were idle enough to give
him the Command of the _Scots_ Ship, and order'd him to fit her out with
all Expedition, and to take on board some Men and Goods left in the
Brigantine: He set to work on the Ship, with full Design to run away
with her; but some Pyrates, who were in another Part of the Island,
being informed of these Proceedings, thought it not prudent to trust
him, so he left the Ship, and getting among his old Comrades, by their
Interposition, had all his Money return'd.

After this he lived five Months on the Island of St. _Mary_'s, where his
House was, by Accident, burnt down, out of which he saved nothing but
his Money; he then went on board _David Williams_, when he miss'd the
Island of _Mascarenas_, and returned to _Methelage_, where he staid with
the King, and was one of the Men among whom he divided _William_'s
Effects.

From _Methelage_ he went with a Parcel of Samsams to _Augustine_, with
which he bought fifty Slaves, whom he sold to the _Arabians_. In his
Return to _Methelage_, he met Captain _North_ in a Sloop, with thirty of
_Miller_'s Men on board; these Men propos'd the taking _Burgess_, who
had, they said, betrayed, ruined, and banished them their Country, by
forcing them to turn Pyrates; but _North_ would not consent: Upon which,
they confined him, took _North_ and stripp'd him of all the Money, and
then releasing their Captain, gave him 300 l. as his Share, which he
returned to _Burgess_ on his Arrival at _Methelage_.

_Burgess_ lived here two or three Years, till he was carried off by some
_Dutchmen_; they belonged to an _East-India_ Man, and were taken by two
_French_ Ships, which being bound for _Mocha_, and scarce of Provisions,
came into _Methelage_ to victual, where they set 80 of their Prisoners
ashore. When they parted from this Port they sail'd for _Johanna_, where
they left the _Dutch_ Officers, who built a Ship, and came back for
their Men. _Burgess_ being of great Use to them, they took him on board,
and steer'd for a Port, where some _Dutch_, taken in another Ship, were
maroon'd; but they were wreck'd at _Youngoul_, where _Burgess_ continued
eighteen Months. After this Time was expir'd, he was desirous of leaving
the Place, and addressing himself to the King, who was Uncle to the King
of _Methelage_, he requested his black Majesty to send him back to that
Port, which he readily complied with, where _Burgess_ continued almost
five Years, afflicted with Sickness, in which he lost one Eye. While he
was here, the _Drake_ Pink, of _London_, came in for Slaves, he took
_Burgess_, with Design to carry him home; but Captain _Harvey_ in the
_Henry_, which belong'd to the same Owners, arriving, and being a
Stranger to the Trade, at the Request of Captain _Maggot_, Commander of
the _Drake_, and on Promise of a Ship when in the _West Indies_, he
enter'd as third Mate, and continued with him. Captain _Harvey_ carrying
it pretty high, and disagreeing with the King, lay here 9 Months before
he could slave. _Burgess_ was sent up to tell the King he had not
fulfill'd his Agreement with Captain _Harvey_; the King resented the
being reproach'd by a Man whom he had entertained so many Years, and
reviled him; he was, however, carried to Dinner with some of the
principal Blacks, and drank very plentifully with them of Honey Toke, in
which it is supposed he was poison'd, for he fell ill and died soon
after, leaving what he had to the Care of the chief Mate, for the Use of
his Wife and Children.




                                APPENDIX
                                 TO THE
                             First VOLUME.


We have already touched upon the History of some of the Pyrates, which
we shall have Occasion to name here over again; but since the printing
our first Volume, the following Relations are fallen into our Hands,
which being much more curious and particular than any Thing hitherto
made publick upon these Affairs, we are satisfied our Readers will find
their Entertainment in the Perusal of it.

About the 20th of _July_ 1718, Mr. _Woods Rogers_, Governor and
Vice-Admiral of the _Bahama_ Islands, being sent from _England_ with the
King's Proclamation, and Pardon for all Pyrates who had surrendered by a
Time specified in the said Proclamation, arrived at _Providence_. It was
Evening when the Fleet came off the Town of _Nassau_ in the said Island,
when _Richard Turnley_, the Pilot, who was on board the _Delicia_, did
not judge it safe to venture over the Bar that Night, wherefore it was
resolved to lie bye till Morning.

In the mean Time there came some Men on board the Fleet from off a
little Island, called _Harbour Island_, adjacent to _Providence_. The
Advice they brought was, that there were near a thousand Pyrates on
Shore upon the Island of _Providence_, waiting for the King's Pardon,
which had been long expected. The principal of their Commanders were
_Benj. Horneygold_, _Arthur Davis_, _Jos. Burgess_, _Tho. Carter_, and
they were all in or about the Town of _Nassau_; that the Fort was
extremely out of Repair, there being only one Gun mounted, a nine
Pounder, and no Accommodation for Men, but one little Hut or House,
which was inhabited by an old Fellow, whom the Pyrates, in Derision,
called Governor _Sawney_.

The Fleet was seen from the Harbour, as well as the Town, so that
Captain _Charles Vane_, who had no Design of surrendring; but, on the
contrary, had fitted out his Ship with a Resolution of attempting new
Adventures, took the Advantage of the Night to contrive his Escape; and
though the Harbour was blocked up, and his Ship drew too much Water to
get out by t'other East Passage, he shifted his Hands, and Things of
most Value, into a lighter Vessel, and charging all the Guns of the Ship
he quitted with Double-Round and Partridge, he set it on Fire,
imagining, that some of the Ships, or their Boats, might be sent near
him, and he might do some Mischief when it should burn down to them.

Those in the Fleet saw the Light, and heard the Guns, and fancied the
Pyrates on Shore were making Bonfires, and firing Guns for Joy that the
King's free Pardon was arrived; and Captain _Whitney_, Commander of the
_Rose_ Man of War, sent his Boat with his Lieutenant on Shore, which was
intercepted by _Vane_, who carried the Crew on Board, and stripped them
of some Stores they had in the Boat, he kept them till he got under
Sail, which was till Day-break, when there was Light enough for him to
see how to steer his Way through the East Passage; which was no sooner
done but he hoisted a black Flag, and fired a Gun, and then let the
Lieutenant and Boat's Crew depart and join the Fleet.

The Fleet got safe into the Harbour, and as soon as the Lieutenant
arrived on Board, and related what had passed, the _Buck_ Sloop was
ordered to chace _Vane_; she made what Sail she could through the East
Passage after him, having a Recruit of Men well armed sent to her from
the other Ships; but being heavily laden with rich Goods, _Vane_ had the
Heels of her, which the Commadore observing, made a Signal for her to
leave off the Chace, and return, which she did accordingly.

They immediately fell to mooring and securing their Ships, which took up
the Time till Night: Next Morning the Governor went on Shore, being
received at his Landing by the principal People in the Government of the
Place, as _Thomas Walker_, Esq; Chief Justice, and _Thomas Taylor_, Esq;
President of the Council; the Pyrate Captains, _Hornygold_, _Davis_,
_Carter_, _Burghess_, _Currant_, _Clark_, with some others, drew up
their Crews in two Lines, reaching from the Water-Side to the Fort, the
Governor and other Officers marching between them; in the mean Time,
they being under Arms, made a running Fire over his Head.

Being arrived at the Fort, his Commission was opened and read, and he
was sworn in Governor of the Island, according to Form.

The next Day the Governor made out a Commission to _Richard Turnley_,
the chief Pilot, to Mr. _Salter_, a Factor, and some others, to go on
Board and examine all suspected Ships and Vessels in the Harbour, to
take an Inventory of their several Ladings, and to secure both Ship and
Cargo for the Use of the King and Company, till such Time as a Court of
Admiralty could be called, that they might be lawfully cleared or
condemned by proving which belonged to Pyrates, and which to fair
Traders.

The Day following a Court-Martial was held, in which a military
Discipline was settled, in order to prevent Surprizes, both from
_Spaniards_ and Pyrates, till such Time as the Fort could be repaired,
and put into a Condition of Defence; for this Purpose the Governor was
obliged to make Use of some of the pardoned Pyrates, such as
_Hornygold_, _Davis_ and _Burghess_, to whom he gave some Commands; and
_George Fetherston_, _James Bonney_, and _Dennis Macartey_, with some
other Pyrates of a lower Rank, acted under them as inferior Officers.

Soon after the civil Government was also setled, some of the principal
Officers being appointed Justices of the Peace, others of inferior
Degree, Constables and Overseers of the Ways and Roads, which were
overgrown with Bushes and Underwood, all about the Town of _Nassau_; so
that if any Enemy had landed in the Night, they might lie in Ambuscade
in those Covers, and surprize the Town; wherefore several of the common
Pyrates were employed in clearing away the said Bushes and Underwood.

The Governor, with some Soldiers, guarded the Fort, and the Inhabitants,
who were form'd into Train'd-Bands, took Care of the Town; but as there
was no Sort of Accommodation to lodge such a Number of People, they were
forced to unbend the Sails, and bring them on Shore, in order to make
Tents, till they had Time to build Houses, which was done with all
possible Expedition, by a Kind of Architecture altogether new.

Those that were built in the Fort were done by making six little Holes
in the Rock, at convenient Distances, in each of which was stuck a
forked Pole; on these, from one to t'other, were placed cross Poles or
Rafters, which being lathed at Top, and on the Sides, with small Sticks,
were afterwards covered with _Palmata_ Leaves, and then the House was
finished; for they did not much trouble themselves about the Ornaments
of Doors and Windows.

In the mean Time the repairing the Fort was carried on, and the Streets
were ordered to be kept clean, both for Health and Conveniency, so that
it began to have the Appearance of a civilized Place.

A Proclamation was published for the Encouragement of all such Persons
should be willing to settle upon the Island of _Providence_, by which
every Person was to have a Lot of Ground of a hundred and twenty Foot
square, any where in or about the Town of _Nassau_, that was not before
in the Possession of others, provided they should clear the said Ground,
and build a House tenantable, by a certain Time therein limited, which
might be easily done as they might have Timber for nothing. This had the
Effect proposed, and a great many immediately fell to work to comply
with the Conditions, in order to settle themselves there.

Many of the Pyrates were employed in the Woods in cutting down Sticks to
make Pallisadoes; and all the People belonging to the Ships (Officers
excepted) were obliged to work four Days in the Week upon the
Fortifications, so that in a short Time a strong Entrenchment was cast
round the Fort, and being well pallisadoed, it rendered the Fort
tolerably strong.

But it did not much suit the Inclinations of the Pyrates to be set to
work; and though they had Provision sufficient, and had also a good
Allowance of Wine and Brandy to each Man, yet they began to have such a
hankering after their old Trade, that many of them took Opportunities of
seizing Perriaguas, and other Boats, in the Night, and making their
Escapes, so that in a few Months there was not many of them left.

However, when the _Spanish_ War was proclaim'd, several of them return'd
back again of their own Accords, being tempted with the Hopes of being
employed upon the privateering Account, (which is something like
pyrating;) for that Place lying near the Coast of _Spanish America_, and
also not far from the Gulph of _Florida_, seemed to be a good Station
for intercepting the _Spanish_ Vessels going to old _Spain_.

They were not mistaken in this Supposition, for the Governor, according
to the Power vested in him, did grant Commissions for privateering, and
made Choice of some of the principal Pyrates who had continued upon the
Island, in Obedience to the Pardon, for Commanders, as being Persons
well qualified for such Employments, who made up their Crews chiefly of
their scattered Companions, who were newly returned upon the Hopes of
Preferment.

About this Time a Fishing Vessel belonging to the Island of _Providence_
brought in the Master of a Ship and a few Sailors, whom she had picked
up at Sea in a Canoe; the said Master was called Captain _King_, who
sailed in a Ship called the _Neptune_, belonging to _South-Carolina_,
loaden with Rice, Pitch, Tar, and other Merchandizes, bound for
_London_.

The Account he gave of himself was, that he was met with by _Charles
Vane_ the Pyrate, who carried him into _Green Turtle_ Bay, one of the
_Bahama_ Islands, by whom he was plundered of a great Part of his
Cargoe, which consisting chiefly of Stores, was of great Use to them;
that afterwards they cut away Part of one of the Masts of the Ship, and
fired a Gun down her Hold, with Design of sinking her; that they took
some of his Men into their Service, and when they were sailing off gave
him and the rest a Canoe to save themselves; that with this Canoe they
made shift to sail from one little Island to another, till they had the
good Luck to meet the Fishing Boat which took them up; and that he
believed _Charles Vane_ might still be cruising thereabouts.

Upon this Intelligence the Governor fitted out a Ship which was named
the _Willing Mind_, mann'd with fifty stout Hands, well armed, and also
a Sloop with thirty Hands, which he sent to cruise amongst those
Islands, in search of _Vane_ the Pyrate, giving them Orders also to
endeavour to recover the Ship _Neptune_, which Captain _King_ told them
had still Goods of a considerable Value left in her.

They went out accordingly, but never saw _Vane_; however, they found the
_Neptune_, which was not sunk as the Pyrates intended; for the Ball they
fired into her stuck in the Ballast, without passing through, by Reason
the Gun had not been sufficiently charged, and so they returned with her
about the 10th of _November_; but an unlucky Accident happened to the
Ship _Willing Mind_, occasioned either by the ignorance or Carelessness
of the Pilot, which was bulged in going over the Bar.

In the mean Time _Vane_ made towards the Coast of _Hispaniola_, living
riotously on Board, having store of Liquor, and plenty of fresh
Provisions, such as Hogs, Goats, Sheep, Fowl, which he got upon easy
Terms, for touching at a Place called _Isleatherer_, he plundered the
Inhabitants of as much of their Provision as they could carry away: Here
they cruised to about _February_, when, near the Windward Passage of
Cape _Mase_, they met with a large rich Ship of _London_, called the
_Kingston_, loaden with Bale Goods, and other rich Merchandize, and
having several Passengers on Board, some _English_, and some _Jews_,
besides two Women.

Towards the North-End of _Jamaica_ they also met with a Turtle Sloop,
bound in for that Island, on Board of which (after having first
plundered her) they put the Captain of the _Kingston_, and some of his
Men, and all the Passengers, except the two Women, whom they kept for
their own Entertainment, contrary to the usual Practice of Pyrates, who
generally sent them away, least they should occasion Contention.

The Ship _Kingston_ they kept for their own Use; for now their Company
being strengthened by a great many Recruits, some Voluntiers, and some
forced Men out of the _Neptune_ and _Kingston_, they thought they had
Hands enough for two Ships; accordingly they shifted several of their
Hands on Board the _Kingston_, and _John Rackham_, alias _Callico Jack_,
(so called, because his Jackets and Drawers were always made of Callico)
Quarter-Master to _Vane_, was unanimously chosen Captain of the
_Kingston_.

The Empire of these Pyrates had not been long thus divided before they
had like to have fallen into a civil War amongst themselves, which must
have ended in the Destruction of one of them. The fatal Occasion of the
Difference betwixt these two Brother Adventurers, was this;--It happened
that _Vane_'s Liquor was all out, who sending to his Brother Captain for
a Supply, _Rackham_ accordingly spared him what he thought fit; but it
falling short of _Vane_'s Expectation, as to Quantity, he went on Board
of _Rackham_'s Ship to expostulate the Matter with him, so that Words
arising, _Rackham_ threaten'd to shoot him thro' the Head, if he did not
immediately return to his own Ship; and told him likewise, that if he
did not sheer off, and part Company, he would sink him.

_Vane_ thought it best to take his Advice, for he thought the other was
bold enough to be as good as his Word, for he had it in his Power to be
so, his Ship being the largest and strongest of the two.

Accordingly they parted, and _Rackham_ made for the Island of _Princes_,
and having great Quantities of rich Goods on Board, taken in the late
Prizes, they were divided into Lots, and he and his Crew shared them by
throwing Dice, the highest Cast being to choose first: When they had
done, they packed up their Goods in Casks, and buried them on Shore in
the Island of _Princes_, that they might have Room for fresh Booty. In
the mean Time it happened that a Turtle Sloop belonging to _Jamaica_
came in there, _Rackham_ sent his Boat, and brought the Master on Board
of him, and asking him several Questions, the Master informed him, that
War with _Spain_ had been proclaimed in _Jamaica_; and that the Time
appointed by the general Pardon for Pyrates to surrender, in order to
receive the Benefit thereof, was not expired.

Upon this Intelligence _Rackham_ and his Crew suddenly changed their
Minds, and were resolved to take the Benefit of the Pardon by a speedy
Surrender; wherefore, instead of using the Master ill, as the poor Man
expected, they made him several Presents, desiring him to sail back to
_Jamaica_, and acquaint the Governor they were willing to surrender,
provided he would give his Word and Honour they should have the Benefit
of the Pardon; which, as extensive as it was, they apprehended they were
not intitled to, because they had run away in Defiance of it at
_Providence_. They desired the Master also to return with the Governor's
Answer, assuring him he should be no Loser by the Voyage.

The Master very willingly undertook the Commission, and arriving at
_Jamaica_, delivered his Message to the Governor, according to his
Instructions; but it happened that the Master of the _Kingston_, with
his Passengers, being come to _Jamaica_, had acquainted the Governor
with the Pyracies of _Vane_ and _Rackam_, before the Turtler got
thither, who was actually fitting out two Sloops, which were now just
ready, in pursuit of them, so that the Governor was very glad to
discover, by the Turtler's Message, where _Rackam_ was to be found.

The two Sloops, well mann'd, accordingly sailed out, and found _Rackam_
in the Station where the Turtler had described him, but altogether in
Disorder, and quite unprepared, either for Sailing or for Fight, most of
his Sails being on Shore erected into Tents, and his Decks lumber'd with
Goods; he happen'd to be on Board himself, tho' most of his Men were
ashore, and seeing the two Sloops at a Distance, bearing towards him, he
observed them with his Glass, and fancied he saw on Board something like
Preparations for fighting. This was what he did not expect, for he
look'd for no Enemy, and while he was in Doubt and Suspence about them,
they came so near that they began to fire.

He had neither Time nor Means to prepare for Defence, so that there was
nothing to be done but to run into his Boat, and escape to the Shore,
which he did accordingly with the few Hands he had with him, leaving the
two Women on Board to be taken by the Enemy.

The Sloops seized the Ship _Kingston_, mann'd her, and brought her into
_Jamaica_, having still a great part of her Cargoe left; when she
arrived, the Master of her fell to examining what part of the Cargoe was
lost, and what left; he searched also for his Bills of Lading and
Cockets, but they were all destroyed by _Rackam_; so that the Ship being
freighted by several Owners, the Master could not tell whose Property
was saved, and whose lost, till he had fresh Bills of Parcels of each
Owner from _England_. There was one remarkable Piece of good Luck which
happened in this Affair; there were, amongst other Goods, sixty Gold
Watches on Board, and thirty of Silver; the Pyrates divided the Silver
Watches, but the Gold being packed up amongst some Bale Goods, were
never discovered by them, and the Master, in searching, found them all
safe.

In the mean Time _Rackam_ and his Crew lived in the Woods, in very great
Suspence what to do with themselves; they had with them Ammunition and
small Arms, and also some of the Goods, such as Bales of Silk Stockings,
and laced Hats, with which, it is supposed, they intended to make
themselves fine; they had also two Boats and a Canoe.

Being divided in their Resolutions, _Rackam_ with six more determined to
take one of the Boats, and make the best of their Way for the Island of
_Providence_, and there claim the Benefit of the King's Pardon, which
they fancied they might be intitled to, by representing, that they were
carried away by _Vane_, against their Wills. Accordingly they put some
Arms, Ammunition and Provision, into the best Boat, and also some of the
Goods, and so set Sail. They first made the Island of _Pines_, from
thence got over to the North-Side of _Cuba_, where they destroyed
several _Spanish_ Boats and Launces; one they took, which being a stout
Sea Boat, they shifted themselves and their Cargoe into her, and sunk
their own, and then stretched over to the Island of _Providence_, where
they landed safely about the Middle of _May_ 1719, where demanding the
King's Pardon, the Governor thought fit to allow it them, and
Certificates were granted to them accordingly.

Here they sold their Goods, and spent the Money merrily; when all was
gone, some ingaged themselves in Privateers, and others in trading
Vessels.

But _Rackam_, as Captain, having a much larger Share than any of the
rest, his Money held out a little longer; but happening about this Time
to come acquainted with _Anne Bonny_, that made him very extravagant.
_Anne Bonny_, as has been taken Notice of in the first Volume, was
married to _James Bonny_, one of the pardoned Pyrates, a likely young
Fellow, and of a sober Life, considering he had been a Pyrate; but
_Anne_, who was very young, soon turned a Libertine upon his Hands, so
that he once surpriz'd her lying in a Hammock with another Man. _Rackam_
made his Addresses to her till his Money was all spent; but as he found
there was no carrying on an Amour with empty Pockets, he ingaged himself
with Captain _Burghess_, lately a Pyrate, but pardoned, who had received
a Commission to privateer upon the _Spaniards_. This Cruize proved
successful; they took several Prizes, amongst the rest, two of
considerable Value, one loaded with Cocoa Nut, and another with Sugar.
They brought them into _Providence_, and found Purchasers amongst the
Factors, who came from other Places for that Purpose. The Dividend was
considerable, and as soon as possible disposed of: _Burghess_ sailed out
in Quest of new Purchase; but _Rackam_, who had nothing but _Anne Bonny_
in his Head, staid behind to spend his Money, and enjoy his Mistress.

_Rackam_ lived in all Manner of Luxury, spending his Money liberally
upon _Anne Bonny_, who was so taken with his Generosity, that she had
the Assurance to propose to her Husband to quit him, in order to cohabit
with _John Rackam_; and that _Rackam_ should give him a Sum of Money, in
Consideration he should resign her to the said _Rackam_ by a Writing in
Form, and she even spoke to some Persons to witness the said Writing.

The Story made some Noise, so that the Governor hearing of it, sent for
her and one _Anne Fulworth_, who came with her from _Carolina_, and
pass'd for her Mother, and was privy to all her loose Behaviour, and
examining them both upon it, and finding they could not deny it, he
threaten'd if they proceeded further in it, to commit them both to
Prison, and order them to be whipp'd, and that _Rackam_, himself, should
be their Executioner.

These Menaces made her promise to be very good, to live with her
Husband, and to keep loose Company no more; but all this was
Dissimulation, for _Rackam_ and she consulting together, and finding
they could not by fair Means enjoy each other's Company with Freedom,
resolved to run away together, and enjoy it in Spight of all the World.

To this Purpose they plotted together to seize a Sloop which then lay in
the Harbour, and _Rackam_ drew some brisk young Fellows into the
Conspiracy; they were of the Number of the Pyrates lately pardoned, and
who, he knew, were weary of working on Shore, and long'd to be again at
their old Trade.

The Sloop they made choice of was betwixt thirty and forty Tun, and one
of the swiftest Sailors that ever was built of that Kind; she belong'd
to one _John Haman_, who lived upon a little Island not far from
_Providence_, which was inhabited by no humane Creature except himself
and his Family, (for he had a Wife and Children) his Livelihood and
constant Employment was to plunder and pillage the _Spaniards_, whose
Sloops and Launces he had often surprized about _Cuba_ and _Hispaniola_,
and sometimes brought off a considerable Booty, always escaping by a
good Pair of Heels, insomuch that it become a Bye-Word to say, _There
goes_ John Haman, _catch him if you can_. His Business to _Providence_
now was to bring his Family there, in order to live and settle, being
weary, perhaps, of living in that Solitude, or else apprehensive if any
of the _Spaniards_ should discover his Habitation, they might land, and
be revenged of him for all his Pranks.

_Anne Bonny_ was observed to go several times on Board this Sloop; she
pretended to have some Business with _John Haman_, therefore she always
went when he was on Shore, for her true Errand was to discover how many
Hands were aboard, and what kind of Watch they kept, and to know the
Passages and Ways of the Vessel.

She discovered as much as was necessary; she found there were but two
Hands on Board; that _John Haman_ lay on Shore every Night: She inquired
of them, Whether they watch'd? Where they lay? And ask'd many other
Questions; to all which they readily answered her, as thinking she had
no Design but common Curiosity.

She acquainted _Rackam_ with every Particular, who resolved to lose no
Time, and therefore, acquainting his Associates, who were eight in
Number, they appointed an Hour for meeting at Night, which was at twelve
o'Clock. They were all true to the Roguery, and _Anne Bonny_ was as
punctual as the most resolute, and being all well armed, they took a
Boat and rowed to the Sloop, which was very near the Shore.

The Night seemed to favour the Attempt, for it was both dark and rainy.
As soon as they got on Board, _Anne Bonny_, having a drawn Sword in one
Hand and a Pistol in the other, attended by one of the Men, went strait
to the Cabin where the two Fellows lay who belonged to the Sloop; the
Noise waked them, which she observing, swore, that if they pretended to
resist, or make a Noise, she would blow out their Brains, (that was the
Term she used.)

In the mean Time _Rackam_ and the rest were busy heaving in the Cables,
one of which they soon got up, and, for Expedition sake, they slipped
the other, and so drove down the Harbour: They passed pretty near the
Fort, which hailed them, as did also the Guardship, asking them where
they were going; they answered, their Cable had parted, and that they
had nothing but a Grappling on Board, which would not hold them.
Immediately after which they put out a small Sail, just to give them
steerage Way. When they came to the Harbour's Mouth, and thought they
could not be seen by any of the Ships, because of the Darkness of the
Night, they hoisted all the Sail they had, and stood to Sea; then
calling up the two Men, they asked them if they would be of their Party;
but finding them not inclined, they gave them a Boat to row themselves
ashore, ordering them to give their Service to _Haman_, and to tell him,
they would send him his Sloop again when they had done with it.

_Rackam_ and _Anne Bonny_, both bore a great Spleen to one _Richard
Turnley_, whom _Anne_ had ask'd to be a Witness to the Writing, which
_James Bonny_, her Husband, was to give to _Rackam_, by which she was to
be resigned to him; _Turnley_ refused his Hand upon that Occasion, and
was the Person who acquainted the Governor with the Story, for which
they vowed Revenge against him. He was gone from _Providence_ a turtling
before they made their Escape, and they knowing what Island he was upon,
made to the Place. They saw the Sloop about a League from the Shore a
fishing, and went aboard with six Hands; but _Turnley_, with his Boy, by
good Luck, happened to be ashore salting some wild Hogs they killed the
Day before; they inquired for him, and hearing where he was, rowed
ashore in Search of him.

_Turnley_ from the Land saw the Sloop boarded, and observed the Men
afterwards making for the Shore, and being apprehensive of Pyrates,
which are very common in those Parts, he, with his Boy, fled into a
neighbouring Wood. The Surf was very great, so that they could not bring
the Boat to Shore; they waded up to the Arm-Pits, and _Turnley_, peeping
through the Trees, saw them bring Arms on Shore: Upon the whole, not
liking their Appearance, he, with his Boy, lay snug in the Bushes.

When they had looked about and could not see him, they hollow'd, and
call'd him by his Name; but he not appearing, they thought it Time lost
to look for him in such a Wilderness, and therefore they returned to
their Boat, but rowed again back to the Sloop, and took away the Sails,
and several other Things. They also carried away with them three of the
Hands, _viz._ _Richard Connor_ the Mate, _John Davis_, and _John Howel_,
but rejected _David Soward_ the fourth Hand, tho' he had been an old
experienced Pyrate, because he was lame, and disabled by a Wound he had
formerly received.

When they had done thus much, they cut down the Main-Mast, and towing
the Vessel into deep Water, sunk her, having first put _David Soward_
into a Boat to shift for himself; he made Shift to get ashore, and after
some Time, having found out _Turnley_, he told him, that _Rackam_ and
_Mary Stead_ were determined, if they could have found him, to have
whipp'd him to Death, as he heard them vow with many bitter Oaths and
Imprecations; for whipping was the Punishment the Governor had
threatened her with by his Information.

From thence they stretch'd over to the _Bury Islands_, plundering all
the Sloops they met, and strengthening their Company with several
additional Hands, and so went on till they were taken and executed at
_Port Royal_, as has been told in the first Volume.

About this Time, the Governor, in Conjunction with some Factors then
residing at _Providence_, thought fit to freight some Vessels for a
trading Voyage; accordingly the _Batchelor_'s _Adventure_, a Schooner,
Captain _Henry White_, Commander; the _Lancaster Sloop_, Captain
_William Greenway_, Commander; the _May Sloop_, Captain _John Augur_,
Commander, of which last _David Soward_ was Owner, (it having been given
him by some Pyrates his former Associates) in which he also sail'd this
Voyage, were fitted out with a Cargo of Goods and Merchandizes, bound
for _Port Prince_ on the Island of _Cuba_.

The Governor thought it adviseable, for the Benefit of the Inhabitants
of _Providence_, to settle a Correspondence with some Merchants at _Port
Prince_, first, in order to procure fresh Provisions, there being scarce
any upon the Island at the Governor's first Arrival; and there being at
_Port Prince_ great Plenty of Cows and Hogs, he proposed to get a
sufficient Number of each, to stock the Island for Breed, that the
People for the future might have fresh Provision of their own.

They set Sail on _Sunday_ the fifth of _October_, 1718; the next Day
they arrived at an Island known by the Name of _Green Key_, lying South,
South-East from _Providence_, in the Degree of 23 and 40 North Latitude,
being distance about twenty five Leagues; they cast Anchor, in order to
wait for Morning to carry them thro' some Rocks and Shoals which lay in
their Way, and some went ashore to try to kill something for Supper,
before it should be dark; they expected to meet some wild Hogs, for,
some Time before, one _Joseph Bay_ and one _Sims_, put two Sows and a
Boar into the said Island; for they living at that Time at _Providence_,
and being continually visited by Pyrates, were always plundered of all
their fresh Provisions; wherefore, they thought of settling a Breed upon
_Green Key_, that they might have Recourse to in Time of Necessity.

This Island is about nine Miles in Circumference, and about three Miles
broad in the widest Place; it is overgrown with wild Cabbage and Palmuta
Trees, and great Variety of other Herbs and Fruits, so that there is
Plenty of Food for the Nourishment of such Animals; but the Trees lying
so close together, makes it but bad Hunting, so that they kill'd but one
Hog, which, however was of a monstrous Size.

The Hunters returned on Board their Ships again before Seven, having
first divided the Hog, and sent part on Board each Vessel for Supper
that Night. After Supper, Captain _Greenway_ and Captain _White_ came on
Board of Captain _Augur_'s Sloop, in order to consult together, what
Time to sail, and being all of Opinion, that if they weigh'd Anchor
betwixt the Hours of ten and eleven, it would be Day before they would
come up with the Shoals; they agreed upon that Hour for setting Sail,
and so return'd to their own Vessels.

Soon after, _Phineas Bunch_, and _Dennis Macarty_, with a great many
others, came from _White_'s Sloop on Board of _Augur_'s; their Pretence
was, that they came to see _Richard Turnley_ and Mr. _James Carr_, who
had formerly been a Midshipman in the _Rose_ Man of War under Captain
_Whitney_, and being a great Favourite of Governor _Rogers_, he had
appointed him Supercargo this Voyage. They desired to be treated with a
Bottle of Beer, for they knew Mr. _Car_ had some that was very good in
his Care, which had been put on Board, in order to make Presents of, and
to treat the _Spanish_ Merchants with.

As it was not suspected they had any Thing else in View, Mr. _Carr_
readily went down, and brought up a Couple of Bottles of Beer: They sat
upon the Poop with Captain _Augur_ in their Company, and were drinking
their Beer; before the second Bottle was out, _Bunch_ and _Macarty_
began to rattle, and talk with great Pleasure, and much boasting of
their former Exploits when they had been Pyrates, crying up a Pyrate's
Life to be the only Life for a Man of any Spirit. While they were
running on in this Manner, _Bunch_ on a sudden started up, and swore
damn him, he would be Captain of that Vessel; _Augur_ answered him the
Vessel did not want a Captain, for he was able to command her himself,
which seem'd to put an End to the Discourse for that Time.

Soon after, _Bunch_ began to tell what bright Arms they had on Board
their Sloop; upon which, one of _Augur_'s Men handed up some of their
Cutlashes which had been clean'd that Day; among them was Mr. _Carr_'s
Silver-hilted Sword; _Bunch_ seem'd to admire the Sword, and ask'd whose
it was; Mr. _Carr_ made Answer it belong'd to him; _Bunch_ replied it
was a very handsome one, and drawing it out, march'd about the Poop,
flourishing it over his Head, and telling Mr. _Carr_ he would return it
to him as soon as he had done with it: At the same Time he began to
vapour again, and to brag of his former Pyracies, and coming near Mr.
_Carr_, struck him with the Sword; _Turnley_ bid him take Care of what
he did, for that Mr. _Carr_ would not take such Usage.

As they were disputing upon this Matter, _Dennis Macarty_ stole off, and
with some of his Associates seiz'd upon the great Cabin where all the
Arms lay: At the same Time several of the Men, began to sing a Song,
with these Words, _Did not you promise me, that you would marry me_
(which it seems was the Signal agreed upon among the Conspirators for
seizing the Ship) _Bunch_ no sooner heard them, but he cried out aloud
by G--d that will I, for I am Parson, and struck Mr. _Carr_ again
several Blows with his own Sword; Mr. _Carr_ and _Turnley_ both seiz'd
him, and they began to struggle, when _Dennis Macarty_, with several
others, return'd from the Cabin with each a Cutlash in one Hand, and a
loaded Pistol in the other, and running up to them said, _What do the
Governor's Dogs offer to resist?_ And beating _Turnley_ and _Carr_ with
their Cutlashes, threaten'd to shoot them: At the same Time firing their
Pistols close to their Cheeks, upon which _Turnley_ and _Carr_ begg'd
their Lives.

When they were thus in Possession of the Vessel, they haled Captain
_Greenway_, and desired him to come on Board about earnest Business: He,
knowing nothing of what had pass'd, takes his Boat, and only with two
Hands rows on Board of them; as soon as he was come, _Dennis Macarty_
leads him into the Cabin, and, as soon as he was there, lays hold of
him, telling him he was now a Prisoner, and must submit: He offered to
make some Resistance; upon which, they told him all Resistance would be
vain, for his own Men were in the Plot; and, indeed, he saw the two
Hands which row'd him aboard now armed, and joining with the
Conspirators; wherefore he thought it was Time to submit.

As soon as this was done, they sent some Hands on Board to seize his
Sloop, or rather to acquaint his Men with what had been done, for they
expected to meet with no Resistance, many of them being in the Plot, and
the rest, they supposed, not very averse to it: After which, they
decoy'd Captain _White_ on Board, by the same Stratagem they used to
_Greenway_, and likewise sent on Board his Sloop, and found his Men, one
and all, well disposed for the Design; and what was most remarkable was,
that Captain _Augur_ seeing how Things were going, joined with them,
shewing himself as well inclined for pyrating as the worst of them.

Thus they made themselves Masters of the three Vessels with very little
Trouble. The next Thing to be done was to resolve how to dispose of
those who were not of their Party; some were for killing _John Turnley_,
but the Majority carried it for marrooning, that he might be starved,
and die like a Dog, as they called it; their great Spleen to him was,
because he was the Person who had piloted the Governor into
_Providence_.

Accordingly _Turnley_, with _John Carr_, _Thomas Rich_, and some others,
were stripp'd naked, and tumbled over the Vessel's Side into a Boat
which lay alongside; the Oars were all taken out, and they left them
nothing to work themselves ashore with but an old Paddle, which, at
other Times serv'd to steer the Boat, and so they commanded them to be
gone.--However, they made shift to get safe ashore to the Island, which,
as we observed before, was quite uninhabited.

The next Morning _Dennis Macarty_, with several others, went on Shore,
and told them they must come on Board again, and they would give them
some Clothes to put on. They fancied the Pyrates began to repent of the
hard Usage they had given them, and were willing to return upon such an
Errand; but when they got on Board again, they found their Opinion of
the Pyrates good Nature was very ill grounded, for they began with
beating them, and did it as if it were in Sport, one having a
Boatswain's Pipe, the rest beating them till he piped _Belay_.

The true Design of bringing them on Board again was to make them
discover where some Things lay, which they could not readily find, as
particularly Mr. _Carr_'s Watch and Silver Snuff-Box; but he was soon
obliged to inform them in what Corner of the Cabin they lay, and there
they were found, with some Journals and other Books, which they knew how
to make no other Use of, but by turning into Cartridges.--Then they
began to question _Thomas Rich_ about a Gold Watch which had once been
seen in his Possession on Shore at _Providence_; but he protested that
it belonged to Captain _Gale_, who was Commander of the Guard-Ship
called the _Delicia_, to which he then belonged; but his Protestations
would have availed him little, had it not been that some on Board who
belonged also to the _Delicia_ knew it to be true, which put an End to
his Beating; and so they were all discharged from their Punishment for
the present.

Some Time after, fancying the Pyrates to be in better Humour, they
begg'd for something to eat, for they had none of them had any
Nourishment that Day or the Night before; but all the Answer they
received was, that such Dogs should not ask such Questions: In the mean
Time, some of the Pyrates were very busy endeavouring to persuade
Captain _Greenway_ to engage with them, for they knew him to be an
excellent Artist, but he was obstinate and would not; then it was
proposed what should be done with him, and the Word went for marrooning,
which was opposed by some, because he was a _Bermudian_, meaning, that
he might perhaps swim away, or swim on board his Vessel again, for the
_Bermudians_ are all excellent Swimmers; but as he represented, that he
could not hurt them by his Swimming, he obtain'd the Favour for himself
and the other Officers, to be set ashore with _Turnley_, _Carr_, and
_Rich_. Accordingly they were put into the same Boat without Oars, to
the Number of eight, and were ordered to make the best of their Way on
Shore.

The Pyrates, the next Day, having examined all their Vessels, and
finding that _Greenway_'s Sloop was not fit for their Purpose, shifted
every Thing out of it; those that were sent on Shore could see from
thence what they were doing, and when they saw them row off, _Greenway_
swam on Board the Sloop, it is likely, to see whether they had left any
Thing behind them. They perceiv'd him, and fancied, he repented his
refusing to join with them, and was come to do it now; wherefore some of
them return'd back to the Sloop, to speak to him, but they found him of
the same Opinion he was in before; however he wheedled them into so much
good Humour, that they told him he might have his Sloop again, in which,
indeed, they had left nothing except an old Main-Sail, and old
Fore-Sail, four small Pieces of _Irish_ Beef, in an old Beef Barrel, and
about twenty Biscuits, with a broken Bucket which was used to draw Water
in, telling him that he and the rest must not go on Board till they were
sail'd.

_Greenway_ swam ashore again to give Notice to his Brothers in Distress,
of what had pass'd; the same Afternoon _Bunch_ with several others went
on Shore, carrying with them six Bottles of Wine and some Biscuits.
Whether this was done to tempt _Greenway_ again, or no, is hard to say;
for tho' they talk'd to him a great Deal, they drank all the Wine
themselves to the last Bottle, and then they gave each of the poor
Creatures a Glass a-piece, with a Bit of Biscuit, and immediately after
fell a beating them, and so went on Board.

While they were on Shore, there came in a Turtle which belong'd to one
_Thomas Bennet_ of _Providence_, whereof one _Benjamin Hutchins_ was
Master; they soon laid hold of her, for she went excellently well;
_Hutchins_ was reputed an extraordinary good Pilot among those Islands,
wherefore they tempted him to engage with them; at first he refused, but
rather than be maroon'd, he afterwards consented.

It was now the ninth of _October_, and they were just preparing to sail,
when they sent on Shore, ordering the _condemn'd Malefactors_ to come on
Board of the _Lancaster_, that was _Greenway_'s Sloop; they did so in
the little Boat they went on Shore in, by the Help of the same Paddle;
they found several of the Pyrates there, who told them that they gave
them that Sloop to return to _Providence_, tho' they let them have no
more Stores, than what were named before; they bad them take the
Fore-Sail, and bend it for a Gib, and furl it close down to the
Boltsprit, and to furl the Main-Sail close up upon the Boom: They did as
they were order'd, for they knew there was no disputing whether it was
right or wrong.

Soon after, another Detachment came on Board, among which were _Bunch_
and _Dennis Macarty_, who being either mad or drunk, fell upon them,
beating them, and cutting the Rigging and Sails to Pieces with their
Cutlashes and commanding them not to sail, till they should hear from
them again, cursing and damning, if they did, they would put them all to
Death, if ever they met them again; and so they went off, carrying with
them the Boat, which they sent them first ashore in, and sail'd away.

They left them in this miserable Condition without Tackle to go their
Voyage, and without a Boat to get on Shore, and having Nothing in View
but to perish for Want; but as Self-Preservation put them upon exerting
themselves, in Order to get out of this deplorable State, they began to
rummage and search the Vessel thro' every Hole and Corner, to see if
nothing was left which might be of use to them; and it happen'd by
Chance that they found an old Hatchet, with which they cut some Sticks
sharp to serve for Marlenspikes; they also cut out several other Things,
to serve instead of such Tools as are absolutely necessary on Board a
Ship.

When they had proceeded thus far, every Man began to work as hard as he
could; they cut a Piece of Cable, which they strung into Rope Yarns, and
fell to mend their Sails with all possible Expedition; they also made a
Kind of Fishing-Lines of the said Rope-Yarns, and bent some Nails
crooked to serve for Hooks; but as they were destitute of a Boat, as
well for the Use of Fishing as for going on Shore, they resolved to make
a Bark Log, that is, to lay two or three Logs together, and tie them
close, upon which two or three Men may sit very safely in smooth Water.

As soon as this was done, some Hands went on Shore, upon one of the said
Logs (for they made two of them) who employ'd themselves in cutting wild
Cabbage, gathering Berries, and a Fruit which the Seamen call Pricklie
Pears, for Food, while some others went a Fishing upon another.--Those
who went ashore also carried the old Bucket with them, so that whilst
some were busy in gathering Things to serve for Provision, one Hand was
constantly employ'd, in bringing fresh Water aboard in the said Bucket,
which was tedious Work, considering how little could be brought at a
Time, and that the Sloop lay near a Mile from the Shore.

When they had employ'd themselves thus, for about four or five Days,
they brought their Sails and Tackle into such Order, having also a
little Water, Cabbage, and other Things on Board, that they thought it
was Time to venture to sail; accordingly they weigh'd their Anchor, and
putting out all the Sail they had, got out to the Harbour's Mouth, when
to their great Terror and Surprize, they saw the Pyrates coming in
again.

They were much frighten'd at the Pyrates unexpected Return, because of
the Threatnings they had used to them at parting, not to sail without
further Orders; wherefore they tack'd about, and ran as close into the
Shore as they could, then throwing out their Bark Logs, they all put
themselves upon them, and made to Land, as fast as they could work; but
before they quite reach'd it, the Pyrates got so near that they fired at
them, but were too far to do Execution; however, they pursued them
ashore; the poor Fugitives immediately took to the Woods, and for
greater Security climb'd up some Trees, whose Branches were very thick,
and by that Means concealed themselves. The Pyrates not finding them,
soon return'd to their Boat, and row'd on board the deserted Sloop,
whose Mast and Boltsprit they cut away, and towing her into deep Water,
sunk her; after which, they made again for the Shore, thinking that the
Fugitives would have been come out of their lurking Holes, and that they
should surprize them; but they continued still on the Tops of their
Trees and saw all that pass'd, and therefore thought it safest to keep
their Posts.

The Pyrates not finding them, return'd to their Vessels, and weighing
their Anchors, set sail, steering Eastward: In the mean time, the poor
Fugitives were in Despair, for seeing their Vessel sunk, they had scarce
any Hopes left of escaping the Danger of perishing upon that uninhabited
Island; there they lived eight Days, feeding upon Berries, and
Shell-Fish, such as Cockles and Perriwinckles, sometimes catching a
Stingrey, a Fish resembling Mead or Thornback, which coming into Shoal
Water, they could wade near them, and by the Help of a Stick sharpen'd
at the End, which they did by rubbing it against the Rock, (for they had
not a Knife left amongst them) they stuck them as if it had been with a
Spear.

It must be observed, that they had no Means of striking a Fire, and
therefore their Way of dressing this Fish was, by dipping it often in
Salt Water, then laying it in the Sun, till it became both hard and dry,
and then they eat it.

After passing eight Days in this Manner, the Pyrates return'd, and saw
the poor Fugitives ashore, who according to Custom made to the Woods;
but their Hearts began to relent towards them, and sending ashore, they
ordered a Man to go into the Woods single, to call out to them, and
promise them upon their Honour, if they would appear, that they would
give them Victuals and Drink, and not use them ill any more.

These Promises, and the Hunger which pinch'd them, tempted them to come
forth, and accordingly they went on Board with them, and they were as
good as their Words, for they gave them as much Beef and Biscuit as they
could eat, during two or three Days they were on Board, but would not
give them a Bit to carry on Shore; they also gave them three or four
Blankets amongst them, to cover their Nakedness (for as we observed,
they were quite naked) and let them have some Needles and Thread, to
make them into some Form.

There was on Board one _George Redding_, an Inhabitant of _Providence_,
who was taken out of the _Turtle Sloop_, and who was a forced Man, being
an Acquaintance of _Richard Turnley_, and knowing, that he was resolved
to go ashore again, rather than engage with the Pyrates, and hearing him
say, that they could find Food to keep them alive, if they had but Fire
to dress it, privately gave him a Tinder-Box, with Materials in it for
striking Fire, which, in his Circumstances, was a greater Present than
Gold or Jewels.

Soon after, the Pyrates put the Question to them, whether they would
engage, or be put ashore? And they all agreed upon the latter: Upon
which a Debate arose amongst the Pyrates, whether they should comply
with their Request or no? And at length it was agreed, that _Greenway_
and the other two Masters should be kept whether they would or no: And
the rest, being five in Number, should be as the Pyrates express'd it,
have a second Refreshment of the Varieties of the Island.

Accordingly _Richard Turnley_, _James Carr_, _Thomas Rich_, _John Cox_,
and _John Taylor_, were a second Time marooned, and the Pyrates as soon
as they landed them, sail'd off, steering Eastward, till they came to an
Island call'd _Pudden Point_, near _Long-Island_ in the Latitude of 24,
where they cleaned their Vessels.

In the mean Time _Turnley_ and his Companions made a much better Shift
than they had done before, his Friend _George Redding_'s Present being
of infinite Use to them, for they constantly kept a good Fire, with
which they broil'd their Fish; there were Plenty of Land Crabs and
Snakes in the Island, which they could eat when they were dress'd, and
thus they pass'd fourteen Days: At the End of which, the Pyrates made
them another Visit, and they according to Custom made for the Woods,
thinking that the Reason of their Return must be, in order to force them
to serve amongst them.

But here they were mistaken, for the Anger of these Fellows being over,
they began to pity them, and came now with a Design to succour them; but
going ashore, and not finding them, they knew they were hid for Fear:
Nevertheless, they left upon the Shore, where they knew they would come,
some Stores which they intended in this Fit of good Humour to present
them with.

The poor Islanders were got to their Retreat, the Tops of the Trees, and
saw the Pyrates go off; upon which they ventured down, and going to the
Water-side, were agreeably surprized to find a small Cask of Flower, of
betwixt twenty and thirty Pounds, about a Bushel of Salt, two Bottles of
Gunpowder, several Bullets, besides a Quantity of small Shot, with a
Couple of Musquets, a very good Axe, and also a Pot and a Pan, and three
Dogs, which they took in the _Turtle Sloop_; which Dogs are bred to
Hunting, and generally the Sloops which go Turtling, carry some of them,
as they are very useful in tracing out the wild Hogs; besides all these,
there were a dozen Horn-handled Knives, of that Sort which are usually
carried to _Guiney_.

They carried all these Things into the Wood, to that Part where they had
their fresh Water, and where they usually kept, and immediately went to
work with their Axe; some cutting down Bows, and making Poles, so that
four of them were employ'd in building a Hut, while _Richard Turnley_
taking the Dogs and a Gun, went a hunting, he understanding that Sport
very well. He had not been gone long before he kill'd a large Boar,
which he brought home to his Companions, who fell to cutting it up, and
some they dress'd for their Dinner, and the rest they salted, for
another Time.

Thus they lived, as they thought, very happy, in respect to their former
Condition; but after four Days, the Pyrates made them another Visit, for
they wanted to fill some Casks with Water: It happen'd when they came
in, that _Turnley_ was gone a Hunting, and the rest all busy at some
Work, so that they did not see them, till they just came into the Wood
upon them; seeing the Hut, one of them in Wantonness set it on Fire, and
it was burnt to the Ground; and they appear'd inclined to do Mischief,
when _Richard Turnley_ knowing nothing of the Matter, happened to return
from Hunting, with a fine Hog upon his Back, as much as he could carry;
he was immediately surrounded by the Pyrates, who seized upon the fresh
Meat, and which seemed to put them into better Humour, they made
_Richard Cox_ carry it down to their Boat, and when he had done, they
gave him a Bottle of Rum to carry back to his Companions to drink their
Healths, telling him, that they might get home if they could, or if they
staid there, they never would trouble them any more.

They were, indeed, as good as their Words, for sailing away immediately,
they made for _Long Island_, and coming up toward the Salt Ponds there,
they saw at a Distance in the Harbour, three Vessels at an Anchor, and
supposing them to be either _Bermudas_ or _New-York_ Sloops lying there
to take in Salt, they bore down upon them with all the Sail they could
make, expecting a good Booty. The _Turtle Sloop_ taken from _Benjamin
Hutchins_, was by much the best Sailor; however, it was almost dark
before she came up with them, and then coming close alongside of one of
them, she gave a Broadside, with a Design to board the next Minute, but
received such a Volley of small Shot in return, as killed and wounded a
great many of the Pyrates, and the rest, in great Surprize and Fright,
jumped overboard, to save themselves by swimming ashore.

The Truth on't is, these Sloops proved to be _Spanish_ Privateers, who
observing the Pyrates to bear down upon them, prepared themselves for
Action: The Commander in Chief of these three Privateers was one who was
called by the Name of _Turn Joe_, because he had once privateer'd on the
_English_ Side; he had also been a Pyrate, and now acted by Vertue of a
Commission from a _Spanish_ Governor. He was by Birth an _Irishman_, a
bold enterprising Fellow, and was afterwards killed in an Engagement
with one _John Bonnavee_, Captain of Privateer belonging to _Jamaica_.

But to return to our Story: The Sloop was taken, and on board her was
found, desperately wounded _Phineas Bunch_, who was the Captain.--By and
by a second of the Pyrate Sloops came up; she heard the Volley, and
supposed it to be fired by _Bunch_, when he boarded one of the Sloops;
she came also alongside of one of the _Spaniards_, and received the
Welcome that was given to _Bunch_, and submitted as soon. A little
after, came up the third, which was taken with the same Ease, and in the
same Manner, as many of the Pyrates as could swim, jumping over board to
save themselves on Shore, there not being a Man lost on the Side of the
_Spaniards_.

The next Day _Turn Joe_ asked them many Questions, and finding out that
several amongst them had been forc'd Men, he, with the Consent of the
other _Spanish_ Officers, ordered all the Goods to be taken out of a
_Spanish_ Launce, and putting some of the wounded Pyrates into the said
Launce, with some Provision, Water, and other Liquors, gave it to the
forced Men, to carry them to _Providence_.

Accordingly _George Redding_, _Thomas Betty_, _Matthew Betty_, _Benjamin
Hutchins_, with some others, set Sail, and in eight and forty Hours
arrived in the Harbour of _Providence_.

They went on Shore immediately, and acquainted the Governor with every
Thing that had pass'd, from the Time of their setting out, acquainting
him, that _Phineas Bunch_, who was one of the chief Authors of all the
Mischief, was on board the _Launce_; the Governor, with some others,
went and examined him, and he confessed all, wherefore there was no
Occasion for a Trial; and as he had been pardoned before, and it was
necessary to make some speedy Example, it was resolved that he should be
executed the next Day, but it was prevented by his dying that Night of
his Wounds.

They also informed the Governor of the Condition of _Turnley_, _Car_,
and the rest, who were marooned by the Pyrates upon _Green Key_ Island;
upon which the Governor sent for one _John Sims_, a Molotto Man, who had
a two Mast Boat in the Harbour of _Providence_, very fit for sailing;
and laying some Provisions into the said Boat, ordered him to get five
or six Hands, and to sail for _Green Key_, in order to bring off the
five Men there marooned.

_Sims_ accordingly made the best of his Way, and sailing out in the
Morning, arrived at _Green Key_ the next Day towards Evening. The poor
People on Shore saw them, and supposing them to be some of the Pyrates
returned, thought it best to take to the Wood and hide, not knowing what
Humour they might be in now.

_Sims_ and his Ship-Mates carried some Provision on Shore, not knowing
but they might want, and searched about, and calling out to them by
their Names. After wandering about some Time, they came to the Place
where the Fire was constantly kept; at perceiving which, they fancied
they must be thereabouts, and that it would be best to wait for them
there, and accordingly they sat them down, laying the Provisions near
them. _Turnley_, who was climbed to the Top of a Tree just by, saw them,
and observed their Motions, and fancied they were no Enemies who were
bringing them Provisions, and, looking more earnestly, he knew _Sims_
the Molotto, whom he was very well acquainted with at _Providence_; upon
which he called him, who desired him to come down, telling him the
comfortable News, that he was come to the Relief of him and his
Companions.

_Turnley_ made what Haste he could to the Bottom, and as soon as he was
down, summoned his Companions, who were climbed to the Top of some
neighbouring Trees, being in Haste to communicate the glad Tidings to
them; being all together, the Molotto related to them the History of
what had happened to the Pyrates.

That Night they supped comfortably together upon the Provision brought
ashore; but so strange an Effect has Joy, that scarce one of them slept
a Wink that Night, as they declared. The next Day they agreed to go a
Hunting, in order to get something fresh to carry off with them, and
were so successful, that they killed three fine Hogs. When they
return'd, they made the best of their Way on Board, carrying with them
all their Utensils, and set Sail for _Providence_, whither they arrived
in three Days; it being now just seven Weeks from the Time of their
being first set on Shore by the Pyrates.

The Governor, in the mean Time, was fitting out a Sloop to send for
_Long Island_, in order to take those Pyrates who had saved themselves
near the Salt Ponds there, which Sloop was now ready to sail, and put
under the Command of _Benjamin Horneygold_; _Turnley_ and his Companions
embarked on Board of her, and Care was taken to get as many Men as they
could, who were entire Strangers to the Pyrates.

When they arrived at the said Island, they run in pretty near the Shore,
keeping but few Hands on Deck, that it might look like a trading Vessel,
and those Men that were quite unknown to the Pyrates.

The Pyrates seeing them, came only two or three of them near the Shore,
the rest lying in Ambush, not without Hopes of finding an Opportunity to
seize the Sloop. The Sloop sent her Boat out towards the Shore, with
Orders to lie off at a little Distance, as if she was afraid: Those in
Ambush seeing the Boat so near, had not Patience to stay any longer, but
flocked to the Water Side, calling out to them to come on Shore, and
help them, for they were poor Ship-wreck'd Men, almost perish'd for
Want. Upon which the Boat row'd back again to the Sloop.

Upon second Thoughts they sent her off again with two Bottles of Wine, a
Bottle of Rum, and some Biscuits, and sent another Man, who was a
Stranger to those ashore, with Orders to pass for Master of the Vessel.
As soon as they approach'd them, the Pyrates call'd to them as before,
begging them, for God's sake to come on Shore; they did so, and gave
them the Biscuit, Wine and Rum, which he said he brought ashore on
purpose to comfort them, because his Men told him they were cast away.
They were very inquisitive to know where he was bound; he told them, to
_New-York_, and that he came in there to take in Salt: They earnestly
intreated him to take them on Board, and carry them as Passengers to
_New-York_; they being about sixteen in Number, he answered, he was
afraid he had not Provision sufficient for so great a Number; but that
he would go on Board and over-hall his Provision, and, if they pleased,
some of them might go with him, and see how his Stock stood, that at
least he would carry some of them, and leave some Refreshment for the
rest, till they could be succoured another Way, but that he hoped they
would make him some Recompence when they should arrive at _New York_.

They seemed wonderfully pleased with his Proposal, and promised to make
him ample Satisfaction for all the Charges he should be at, pretending
to have good Friends and considerable Effects in several Parts of
_America_. Accordingly he took several of them with him in the Boat, and
as soon as they got on Board, he invited them into the Cabin, where, to
their Surprize, they saw _Benjamin Horneygold_, formerly a Brother
Pyrate; but what astonished them more, was to see _Richard Turnley_,
whom they had lately marooned upon _Green Key_; they were immediately
surrounded by several with Pistols in their Hands, and clapped in Irons.

As soon as this was over, the Boat went on Shore again, and those in the
Boat told the Pyrates, that the Captain would venture to carry them with
what Provision he had; at which they appeared much rejoyced, and so the
rest were brought on Board, and without much Trouble clapped in Irons,
as well as their Companions.

The Sloop had nothing more to do, and therefore set Sail, and reaching
_Providence_, delivered the Pyrates all Prisoners into the Fort: A Court
of Admiralty was immediately called, and they were all tried, and ten
received Sentence of Death; the other six were acquitted, it appearing
that they were forced. The following nine were executed in the Manner
described in the first Volume, _John Augur_, _William Cunningham_,
_Dennis Macarty_, _William Lewis_, _Thomas Morris_, _George Bendal_,
_William Morris_, _George Bendal_, _William Ling_, and _George Rogers_.
_George Rounsavil_ was reprieved after he had been tied up, and just
going to be cast off, and was brought down to see the Execution of the
rest.

But we cannot quit this Story without taking Notice of the Fate of this
_George Rounsavil_. He work'd for some Time ashore for his living, but
afterwards ingaged himself with Captain _Burghess_, a pardoned Pyrate,
who had received a Commission to go a privateering. It happened they
were driven upon the Rocks to the Southward of _Green Key_ Island, and
there they were beat to pieces; this _Rounsavil_, with five others, upon
the first Shock, stept into the Canoe, and were going off, when
_Burghess_ standing upon the Poop of his Vessel, call'd out to him,
saying, _Will you go away and leave me to perish in this Manner_.
_Rounsavil_ begg'd his Companions to put back, and take him in; but they
answered, that the rest would be as willing to save themselves as he,
and of Consequence, so many would crowd into the Canoe as would sink it,
wherefore they would not venture it; upon which he jump'd into the
Water, and swam to the Vessel, and there perished with his Friend since
he could not save him.


                          _Of Captain_ TEACH.

We shall add here a few Particulars (not mentioned in our first Volume)
of the famous _Blackbeard_, relating to his taking the South _Carolina_
Ships, and insulting that Colony. This was at the Time that the Pyrates
had obtained such an Acquisition of Strength, that they were in no
Concern about preserving themselves from the Justice of Laws, but of
advancing their Power, and maintaining their Sovereignty, not over the
Seas only, but to stretch their Dominions to the Plantations themselves,
and the Governors thereof, insomuch that when their Prisoners came
aboard their Captors Ships, the Pyrates freely own'd their Acquaintance
with them, and never endeavour'd to conceal their Names, or Habitations,
as if they had been Inhabitants of a legal Commonwealth, and were
resolved to treat with all the World on the Foot of a free State; and
all judicial Acts went in the Name of _Teach_, under the Title of
Commodore.

All the _Carolina_ Prisoners were lodg'd aboard the Commodore's Ship,
after being strictly examin'd concerning the Lading of their Vessels,
and the Number and Condition of other Traders in the Harbour; when they
thought they would sail, and whither bound: And the Enquiry was so
solemnly carried on, that the Pyrates swore, that it should be Death for
that Man that told a Lye, or otherwise shifted or evaded in his Answers.
At the same Time all their Papers were perused with the same Diligence
as though it had been at the Secretary's Office here in _England_. When
this Business was gone through, Word was given, that all the Prisoners
should be immediately turn'd aboard their own Ship, out of which they
had already taken their Provisions and Stores. This was done with that
Hurry and Precipitation, that it struck a great Terror in the
unfortunate People, verily believing they were then going to their
Destruction; and what seem'd to confirm them in this Notion was, that no
Regard was had to the Qualities of the Prisoners, but Merchants,
Gentlemen of Rank, and even a Child of Mr. _Wragg_'s, were thrust aboard
in a tumultuous and confus'd Manner, and lock'd all under the Hatches,
where not so much as one Pyrate stay'd amongst them.

In this melancholly Situation were these innocent People left, bewailing
their Condition for several Hours, expecting every Moment that pass'd
either that a Match would be laid to a Train to blow them up, or that
the Ship was to be set on Fire, or sunk; no Body could tell which, but
every one supposed they were, one Way or other, destin'd for a Sacrifice
to their brutal Humours.

But, at length, a Gleam of Light shot in upon them, that recover'd their
drooping Souls; the Hatches were unlaid, and they were immediately
order'd back on board the Commodore: They began then to think the
Pyrates had changed their savage Resolution; and that God had inspired
them with Sentiments less shocking to Nature and Humanity, and they went
aboard, as it were, with new Life. The Chief of them were brought before
_Blackbeard_, the Pyrates General, who acquainted them with the Occasion
of that extraordinary Procedure; and that they were only put out of the
Way while a general Council was held, at which Time they suffer'd no
Prisoner to be present. He told them, the Company was in want of
Medicines, and must be supply'd from the Province; that their first
Surgeon had drawn up a Catalogue, which he would send to the Governor
and Council, by two of his own Officers, for whose safe Return, as well
as for the Chest it self, they had come to a Resolution of keeping all
the Prisoners as Hostages, who would all be put to Death, if such their
Demands were not comply'd with punctually.

Mr. _Wragg_ answer'd, that, perhaps, it might not be in their Power to
comply with every Part of it; and, he fear'd, that some certain Drugs in
the Surgeon's List, were not to be had in the Province; and, if it
should prove so, he hop'd they would be contented to have that Want made
up by substituting something else in the Place. He likewise proposed,
that one of them might go with the two Gentlemen that were to be sent on
the Embassy, who might truly represent the Danger they were in, and
induce them more readily to submit, in order to save the Lives of so
many of the King's Subjects; and further, to prevent any Insult from the
common People, (for whose Conduct, on such an Occasion, they could not
answer) on the Persons of his Envoys.

His Excellency _Blackbeard_ thought this Advice reasonable, and
therefore call'd another Council, who likewise approv'd of the
Amendment; thereupon Mr. _Wragg_, who was the first in Authority, and
known to be a Man of good Understanding among the _Carolinians_, was
offer'd, and the Gentleman, himself, was willing to leave a young Son in
the Hands of the Pyrates, till he should return, which he promis'd to
do, though the Government should refuse the Terms of their Releasement:
But _Blackbeard_ positively deny'd this Request, saying, he knew too
well of what consequence he was in the _Provence_, and he would be
equally so to them, and therefore he should be the last Man they would
part with.

After some Debate, Mr. _Marks_ was agreed upon to accompany the
Ambassadors, and accordingly they went off from the Fleet in a Canoe,
and two Days were appointed for their Return; in the mean while the
Commadore lay too at five or six Leagues Distance from the Land,
expecting the Conditions of Peace; but the Time expiring, and nothing
appearing from the Harbour, Mr. _Wragg_ was sent for up before _Teach_,
who putting on a terrible Countenance, told him, they were not to be
trifled with, that he imagined some foul Treachery was play'd them, and
that nothing but immediate Death to them all should be the Consequence
of it. Mr. _Wragg_ begg'd to respite the dreadful Execution one Day
longer, for, that he was sure, the Province regarded their Lives so
much, that they would be sollicitous to the last Degree to redeem them;
that, perhaps, some Misfortune might have befallen the Canoe in going
in, or it might be their own Men that occasioned the Delay, for either
of which it would be hard for them to suffer.

_Teach_ was pacified for the present, and allow'd a Day more for their
coming back; but at the End of that Time, how was he enraged to find
himself disappointed, calling them Villains a thousand Times, and
swearing, they should not live two Hours. Mr. _Wragg_, humour'd him all
he could, and desired a good Look-out should be kept. Matters seem'd now
to be coming to Extremities, and no Body thought their Lives worth a
Day's Purchase; the innocent People were under great Agonies of Mind,
expecting that nothing but a Miracle could preserve them from being
crush'd by the Weight of the Enemy's Power, when Word was given from the
Forecastle, that a small Boat appear'd in Sight. This raised their
drooping Spirits, and reviv'd their Hopes; _Blackbeard_ went forward
himself with his Spying-Glass, and declared he could perceive his own
Scarlet Cloak he lent Mr. _Marks_ to go ashore in; this was thought to
be a sure Reprieve, till the Boat came aboard, and then their Fears
returned, seeing neither the Pyrates, Mr. _Marks_, nor the Chest of
Medicines in the Boat.

This Boat, it seems, was sent off by Mr. _Marks_ very discreetly, lest a
Misconstruction should be put upon the Stay, that an unfortunate
Accident had occasioned, and which the Men that belong'd to her
acquainted the Commodore of, _viz._ That the Boat they had sent ashore
was cast away, being overset by a sudden Squall of Wind, and the Men
with great Trouble had got ashore at the uninhabited Island of ......
three or four Leagues from the Main, that having staid there some time
till reduced to Extremity, there being no Provision of any Kind, and
fearing what Disaster might befal the Prisoners aboard; the Persons
belonging to their Company, set Mr. _Marks_ upon a Hatch, and floated it
upon the Sea, after which, they stripp'd and flung themselves in, and
swiming after it, and thrust the Float forward, endeavouring, by that
means, to get to Town. This prov'd a very tedious Voiture, and in all
Likelihood they had perished, had not this Fishing Boat sail'd by in the
Morning, and perceiving something in the Water, made to it, and took
them in, when they were near spent with their Labour.

When they were thus providentially preserv'd, Mr. _Marks_ went into
...... and there hired a Boat which carried them to _Charles Town_; in
the mean time he had sent this Boat to give them an Account of the
Accident. Mr. _Teach_ was pacified with this Relation, and consented to
stay two Days longer, since there appeared no Fault of theirs in causing
this Delay. At the End of two Days, they lost all Patience, and the
Commodore could not be prevail'd on to give them any longer Time than
the next Morning to live, if the Boat did not return by that Time. Still
expecting and still disappointed, the Gentlemen knew not what to say,
nor how to excuse their Friends at Land; some of them told the Pyrates,
that they had equal Reason with them to blame their Conduct; that they
doubted not, by what had already happen'd, of Mr. _Mark_'s doing his
Duty faithfully; and since they had received Notice of the Boat's going
safe into _Charles Town_, they could not conceive what should hinder the
Execution of the Business, unless they put a greater Value on the Chest
of Medicines, than on the Lives of fourscore Men now on the Verge of
Destruction. _Teach_, for his Part, believed they had imprisoned his
Men, and refused the Condition of the Prisoner's Enlargement, and swore
a thousand Times, that they should not only die, but every _Carolina_
Man that hereafter should fall into his Hands. The Prisoners, at last,
petitioned to have this one Favour granted, _viz._ That the Fleet should
weigh and stand off the Harbour, and if they should not then see the
Boat coming out, that they the Prisoners would pilot them in before the
Town, which, if they pleased to batter down, they would stand by them to
the last Man.

This Proposal of taking Revenge for the supposed Treachery (as the
Commodore was pleased to term it) suited well enough the Savage Temper
of the General and his Brutes, and he acquiesc'd at once. The Project
was likewise approv'd on by the Myrmidons, and accordingly they weigh'd
Anchor, being in all eight Sail of Ships, which were the Prizes they had
in Custody, and rang'd along the Town; the Inhabitants then had their
Share of the Fright, expecting nothing less than a general Attack; the
Men were brought all under Arms, but not in so regular a manner as might
have been done, had the Surprize been less; but the Women and Children
ran about the Street like mad Things. However, before Matters came to
Extremities, the Boat was seen coming out, which brought Redemption to
the poor Captives, and Peace to all.

The Chest was brought aboard, and accepted of, and it further appear'd,
that Mr. _Marks_ had done his Duty, and the Blame of the Delay was
deservedly thrown on the two Pyrates that were sent on the Embassy; for
while the Gentlemen attended the Governor and Council upon the Business,
the other fine Gentlemen were visiting and drinking with their _quondam_
Friends and Acquaintance, and going from House to House, so that they
were not to be found when the Medicines were ready to go aboard; and Mr.
_Marks_ knew it were Death to them all to go without them, for the
Commodore would not easily have believ'd, had they not returned, that
there had been no foul Play acted by them. But now none but smiling
Countenances were seen aboard; the Storm that threatned the Prisoners so
heavily, blew over, and a Day of Sun-shine succeeded; in short,
_Blackbeard_ released them as he had promised, and sent them away in the
Ships after he had done with them, and then sail'd off the Coast, as has
been mentioned in _Vol._ I. _page 73_.

                   *       *       *       *       *

What follows, contains Reflections on a Gentleman now deceas'd, who was
Governor of _North Carolina_, namely, _Charles Eden_, Esq; which, we
apprehend, by Accounts since receiv'd, to be without just Grounds,
therefore, it will be necessary to say something in this Place, to take
off the Calumny thrown on his Character, by Persons who have misjudged
of his Conduct by the Height Things appeared in at that time.

Upon a Review of this Part of _Blackbeard_'s Story, it does not seem, by
any Matters of Fact candidly considered, that the said Governour held
any private or criminal Correspondence with this Pyrate; and I have been
inform'd since, by very good Hands, that Mr. _Eden_ always behaved, as
far as he had Power, in a manner suitable to his Post, and bore the
Character of a good Governor, and an honest Man.

But his Misfortune was, the Weakness of the Colony he commanded, wanting
Strength to punish the Disorders of _Teach_, who lorded it at Pleasure,
not only in the Plantation, but in the Governor's own Habitation,
threatening to destroy the Town with Fire and Sword, if any Injury was
offer'd to him or his Companions, insomuch, that he sometimes drew up
his Vessel against the Town, and once, when he suspected that there was
a Design of seizing him, he went ashore to the Governor well armed, and
left Orders with his Men on board, that in Case he should not return in
an Hour's Time (as he determined, if at Liberty) to batter down the
House about their Ears, without any more to do, notwithstanding he
himself were to be in it. Such were the outragious Insolencies of this
Villain, who was so big with Mischief, that he resolved to be revenged
upon his Enemies at all Events, even tho' he should give up his own
Life, as a Sacrifice, to obtain those wicked Ends.

It is to be observed, that _Blackbeard_, nevertheless, as to his
Pyracies, had comply'd with the Proclamation, and thereby satisfied the
Law, and having a Certificate thereof from under the Hand of his
Excellency, he could not be prosecuted for any of those Crimes committed
heretofore, because they were wiped off by the said Proclamation of
Pardon: And as to condemning the _French Martinico_ Man that
_Blackbeard_ brought in to _North Carolina_ afterwards, the Governor
proceeded judicially upon her. He called a Court of Vice Admiralty, by
virtue of his Commission; at which four of the Crew swore they found the
Ship at Sea with no Person on board her, so the Court condemn'd her, as
any other Court must have done, and the Cargo was disposed of according
to Law.

As to the secret Expedition from _Virginia_, undertaken by the Governor
and the two Captains of Men of War, they had their secret Views in it:
The Men of War had lain up these ten Months whilst the Pyrates infested
the Coast, and did great Mischief, for which, 'tis likely, they might
have been called to an Account; but the Success of the Enterprize
against _Teach_, alias _Blackbeard_, perhaps prevented such Enquiry,
tho' I am at a Loss to know what Acts of Pyracy he had committed after
this Surrender to the Proclamation; the _French_ Ship was lawfully
condemned, as has been said before, and if he had committed any
Depredations amongst the Planters, as they seem'd to complain of, they
were not upon the high Sea, but either in the River, or on Shore, and
could not come within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, nor under any
Laws of Pyracy. The Governor of _Virginia_ found his Interest in the
Affair; for he sent, at the same time, a Force by Land, and seiz'd
considerable Effects of _Blackbeard_'s in _Eden_'s Province, which was
certainly a new Thing for the Governor of one Province, whose Commission
was limited to that Jurisdiction, to exercise Authority in another
Government, and the Governour himself upon the Spot. Thus was poor Mr.
_Eden_ insulted and abused on all Sides, without having the Power of
doing himself Justice, and asserting his lawful Rights.

In fine, to do Justice to Governor _Eden_'s Character, who is since
dead, there did not appear from any Writings or Letters found in
_Blackbeard_'s Sloop, or from any other Evidence whatsoever, that the
said Governor was concerned at all in any Male Practice; but on the
contrary, that during his Continuance in that Post, he was honour'd and
beloved by his Colony, for his Uprightness, Probity, and prudent Conduct
in his Administration; what Affairs were carried on privately by his
then Secretary I know not; he died a few Days after _Blackbeard_'s
Destruction, and no Enquiry was made; perhaps there might be no Occasion
for it.


                           _Of Major_ BONNET.

I have but few Words to add to Major _Bonnet_'s Life and Actions; when
his Dissolution drew nigh, all his Resolution fail'd him, and his Fears
and Agonies so wrought upon him, that he was scarce sensible when he
came to the Place of Execution. His piteous Behaviour under Sentence,
very much affected the People of the Province, particularly the Women,
and great Application was made to the Governor for saving his Life, but
in vain; not that his Excellency Colonel _Johnson_ pleased himself in
Acts of severe Justice, but he knew his Duty too well to be misled by
the Tears and Prayers of weak and inconsiderate People, when the publick
Good, as well as his own Honour, stood in Question. Had not _Bonnet_
escap'd out of his Keeper's Hand, after he was taken, and occasioned the
Death of his Fellow-Prisoner _Harriot_, by resisting the Governor's
Authority, and therein given a new Specimen of his disloyal Intentions,
something might have been done in his Favour; but he was become too
notorious, and too dangerous a Criminal, to give Life to. However, the
Governor who conducted himself in his Post as well as in his private
Capacity, with great Probity, Honour, and Candour, hearkened to a
Proposal of _Bonnet_'s Friends, which was to send him Prisoner to
_England_, that his Case might be referr'd to his Majesty. Col. _Rhet_
offer'd to go with him, and sufficient Security was to be given for
yielding him up there, to be dealt with according to his Majesty's
Pleasure; but the Major's Friends considered, at last, that it would be
a great Expence and Trouble to no manner of purpose, except the
lengthening out a wretched Life some small Time longer; for they
conceived as little Hope of obtaining a Pardon in _England_ as in _South
Carolina_; so they even submitted to the Execution of that Sentence upon
the Major, that had with so much Justice pass'd upon him. I shall
subjoin here a Copy of a Letter, writ to the Governor from the Prisoner
sometime before he died.

_Honoured Sir_,

'I Have presumed, on the Confidence of your eminent Goodness, to throw
my self, after this manner, at your Feet, to implore you'll graciously
be pleased to look upon me with tender Bowels of Pity and Compassion;
and believe me to be the most miserable Man this Day breathing: That the
Tears proceeding from my most sorrowful Soul may soften your Heart, and
incline you to consider my dismal State, wholly, I must confess,
unprepared to receive so soon the dreadful Execution you have been
pleas'd to appoint me; and therefore beseech you to think me an Object
of your Mercy.

'For God Sake, good Sir, let the Oaths of three Christian Men weigh
something with you, who are ready to depose, when you please to allow
them the Liberty, the Compulsions I lay under in committing those Acts,
for which I am doom'd to die.

'I intreat you not to let me fall a Sacrifice to the Envy and ungodly
Rage of some few Men, who, not being yet satisfied with Blood, feign to
believe, that if I had the Happiness of a longer Life in this World, I
should still employ it in a wicked Manner; which, to remove that and all
other Doubts with your Honour, I heartily beseech you'll permit me to
live, and I'll voluntarily put it ever out of my Power, by separating
all my Limbs from my Body, only reserving the Use of my Tongue, to call
continually on, and pray to the Lord, my God, and mourn all my Days in
Sack-cloth and Ashes to work out confident Hopes of my Salvation, at
that great and dreadful Day, when all righteous Souls shall receive
their just Rewards: And to render your Honour a further Assurance of
being incapable to prejudice any of my Fellow-Christians, if I was so
wickedly bent; I humbly beg you will (as a Punishment of my Sins for my
poor Soul's Sake) indent me a menial Servant to your Honour and this
Government, during my Life, and send me up to the farthest Inland
Garrison or Settlement in the Country, or any otherways you'll be
pleased to dispose of me; and likewise that you'll receive the
Willingness of my Friends to be bound for my good Behaviour, and
constant Attendance to your Commands.

'I once more beg for the Lord's Sake, dear Sir, that as you are a
Christian, you will be so charitable to have Mercy and Compassion on my
miserable Soul, but too newly awaked from an Habit of Sin, to entertain
so confident Hopes and Assurance of its being received into the Arms of
my blessed Jesus, as is necessary to reconcile me to so speedy a Death;
wherefore, as my Life, Blood, Reputation of my Family, and future happy
State lies entirely at your Disposal; I implore you to consider me with
a christian and charitable Heart, and determine mercifully of me, that I
may ever acknowledge and esteem you next to God my Saviour; and oblige
me ever to pray, that our heavenly Father will also forgive your
Trespasses.

'Now the God of Peace, that brought again from the Dead our Lord Jesus,
that great Shepherd of the Sheep, thro' the Blood of the everlasting
Covenant, make you perfect in every good Work to do his Will, working in
you that which is well pleasing in his Sight, through Jesus Christ, to
whom be Glory for ever and ever, is the hearty Prayer of

                                                        _Your Honour's
                                                   Most miserable, and
                                                   Afflicted Servant_,
                                                        STEDE BONNET.'


                          _Of Captain_ WORLEY.

The History of the Pyrates being an Undertaking of great Length and
Variety, the Author readily owns, that in some Parts, he may not be so
exact, as they who have been occasionally upon the Spot when these
particular Incidents have happen'd. But in any Circumstances he has
omitted or misrepresented, he applies to such Persons for better
Information; which Correction or Addition (as several others have been)
shall be inserted as a Supplement to the whole.

And he hereby acknowledges himself much obliged to the worthy Gentleman
who sent the following Letter, for his kind Assistance, in promoting his
chief Design, which is to render as compleat as possible, a Work of so
difficult a Nature.

        _To Mr._ Johnson, _Author of the Lives of the Pyrates_.

SIR,

In perusing your Book, Entitled, _A General History of the Robberies and
Murders of the most notorious Pyrates_, &c. I find there an Account of
the taking Captain _Worley_ and his Crew, in many Particulars of which
you have been very much misinformed, and consequently the Publick is so;
that Pyrate having been taken off the Bar of _Charles Town_ in _South
Carolina_ by Col. _Robert Johnson_, the then Governor, in Person; to
whom to do Justice, I have sent you the following Account of the taking
him; for, as to his Beginning and Rise, I cannot say but your Account
may be right, as you have set it forth in your aforesaid Book.

In _October_, 1718, Governor _Johnson_ was informed, that there was a
Pyrate Ship off the Bar of _Charles Town_, commanded by one _Moody_,
carrying 50 Guns, and near 200 Men, that he had taken two Ships bound to
that Port from _New England_, and was come to an Anchor with them to the
Southward of the Bar; whereupon, he called his Council and the principal
Gentlemen of the Place, and proposed to them, to fit out a proper Force
to go out and attack him, fearing he might lie there some Time, as
_Thatch_ and _Vane_ had done before, and annoy the Trade; which they
unanimously agreeing, and there being, at that Time, 14 or 15 Ships in
the Harbour, he impress'd the _Mediterranean_ Gally, _Arthur Loan_, and
the King _William_, _John Watkinson_, Commanders; and two Sloops, one of
which was the _Revenge_, taken from _Stede Bonnet_, the Pyrate, and
another from _Philadelphia_; the former, Captain _John Masters_
commanded, and the latter, Captain _Fayrer Hall_; which two Captains had
lately commanded the same Sloops that took _Bonnet_ at _Cape Fear_,
about a Month before. On board the _Mediterranean_ was put 24 Guns, and
30 on Board the King _William_; the _Revenge_ Sloop had 8, and the other
Sloop 6 Guns; and being thus equipp'd, the Governor issued a
Proclamation, to encourage Voluntiers to go on Board, promising 'em all
the Booty to be shar'd among them, and that he himself would go in
Person with 'em; but the Ships and Sloops before-mentioned being
impress'd, it was natural for the Commanders to desire some Assurance of
Satisfaction to be made the Owners, in Case of a Misfortune; so that the
Governor found it necessary to call the General Assembly of the
Province, without whom it was impossible for him to give them the
Satisfaction they desired, and who, without any Hesitation, pass'd a
Vote, that they would pay for the said Vessels, in Case they were lost,
according to an Appraisement then made of them, and what other Expences
accrued to carry on this necessary Expedition. This Way of Proceeding
took up a Week's Time, during which, the Governor ordered Scout Boats to
ply up and down the River, as well to guard the Port from any Attempts
the Pyrates might make to Land, as to hinder them from having Advice of
what was doing, and also laid an Embargo on the Shipping.

About three Days before the Governor sail'd, there appear'd off the Barr
a Ship, and a Sloop, who came to an Anchor, and made a Signal for a
Pilot; but they being suppos'd to be _Moody_, and a Sloop that had
join'd him (as it was said he expected) no Pilot was permitted to go
near them, and thus they rid for four Days, once or twice attempting to
send their Boat on Shore, to an Island, call'd, _Suilivants_ Island (as
they afterwards confess'd) to fetch Water, of which they were in great
Want; but they were prevented by the Scout Boats before-mentioned: And,
for Want of which, they were obliged to continue in the same Station, in
hopes some Ship would be coming in or going out, to relieve their
Necessities, they being very short also of Provisions.

And now all Things being ready, and about Three hundred Men on Board the
four Vessels, the Governor thought himself a Match for _Moody_ in his 50
Gun Ship, although he should be, as they thought he was, join'd by a
Sloop: And therefore, he sail'd with his Fleet below _Johnson_'s Fort
over Night, and the next Morning by Break of Day, weigh'd Anchor, and by
Eight in the Morning, they were over the Bar.

The Pyrate Sloop immediately slipt her Cable, hoisted a black Flag, and
stood to get between the Bar and the Governor's Ships, to prevent their
going in again, as they expected they would have done; and in a small
Time after, the Pyrate Ship also hoisted a black Flag, and made Sail
after the Sloop; during all this Time, the Men on Board the Governor's
Vessels did not appear, nor was there any Shew of Guns, until they came
within half Gun-shot; when the Governor hoisted a Flag at the
Main-top-mast Head of the _Mediterranean_, they all flung out their
Guns, and giving them their Broad-sides, the Pyrates immediately run,
whereupon, the Governor ordered the two Sloops after the Pyrate Sloop,
who stood in towards the Shore, while himself and the King _William_
followed the Ship who stood the contrary Way to Sea. She seemed to have
many Ports, and very full of Men, tho' she had fir'd but from two Guns,
which occasion'd no small Wonder on Board the Governor, why she had not
flung open her Ports, and made Use of more Guns, she being imagined all
this while to be _Moody_.

The Sloop, which proved to be _Worley_, was attacked by the two Sloops
so warmly, that the Men run into the Hold, all except _Worley_ himself
and some few others, who were killed on the Deck; and being boarded,
they took her within Sight of _Charles Town_: The People seeing the
Action from the Tops of their Houses, and the Masts of the Ships in the
Harbour, where they had placed themselves for that Purpose; but it was
Three in the Afternoon before the Governor and the King _William_ came
up with the Ship, who, during the Chase, had taken down her Flagg, and
wrapping the small Arms in it, had thrown them over-board; and also
flung over her Boat and what other Things they thought would lighten
her, but all would not do: The King _William_ came first up with her,
and firing his Chase Guns, killed several of the People on board, and
they immediately struck; when, to the no small Surprize of the Governor
and his Company, there appeared near as many Women on board as Men, who
were not a few neither. The Ship proving to be the _Eagle_, bound from
_London_ to _Virginia_, with Convicts; but had been taken by _Worley_
off the _Cape_ of _Virginia_, and had upwards of 100 Men and 30 Women on
board. Many of the Men had taken on with the Pyrates, and as such, found
in _Carolina_ the Fate they had deserved at home, being hang'd at
_Charles Town_; the virtuous Ladies were designed to have been landed on
one of the uninhabited _Bahama_ Islands, where there was a proper Port
for these Rovers to put in, at any Time, to refresh themselves, after
the Fatigue of the Sea. And thus a most hopeful Colony would have
commenced, if they had had but Provisions and Water sufficient to have
carried them to Sea; but their Fate kept them so long before the Port of
_Charles Town_, until they were destroyed, and an End put to their
wicked Lives, in the Manner before-mentioned.

Notwithstanding all the Governor's Care, that no Advice should be given
_Moody_ of the Preparations making for him, some People from the Shore
were so wicked, as to go off in the Night and give him a particular
Account of the Ships, Sloops, and Men, that were preparing to go out
against him; whereupon, he having taken (about three Days before the
Governor went) the _Minerva_, Captain _Smyter_, from the _Maderas_,
laden with Wine, he immediately weighed Anchor and took his Prize with
him, and stood out above one hundred Leagues to Sea, where he plundered
her, and named to the Master not only the Vessels, but some of the very
Persons were coming out to attack him, by which Advice he escaped, and
_Worley_ coming just as the other was gone, met the Fate designed for
_Moody_; who having taken out most of the Wine from on board the
_Minerva_, and plundered her, he discharged, and sail'd for
_Providence_, and soon after took the Benefit of his Majesty's Royal
Proclamation.

The Governor kept the Ships and Vessels in sailing Order some Time, in
Hopes _Moody_ might have come off the Bar again; but being informed by
the _Minerva_ he was sailed for _Providence_, he discharged them, giving
the small Booty taken to the Men who were the Captors, as he had
promised them.

Your Account of the taking of _Bonnet_ is pretty just, which was done by
Governor _Johnson_'s Direction and Commission also.


                          Of Captain _Martel_.

                         _To Captain_ Johnson.

SIR,

Though I can contribute nothing to your Second Volume of Pyrates you
have (as I hear) in Hand, yet, by your Character of Veracity, I perswade
my self I shall oblige you, in rectifying a Mistake you made in your
first. In the Life of Captain _Martel_ you say, the _Greyhound_ Galley
of _London_, which I then commanded, fell into the Hands of that Pyrate,
who plunder'd her of some Gold Dust, Elephants Teeth, and 40 Slaves. The
latter Part of this is just, except the Elephants Teeth, of which I
lost, I think, none; but you are misled in the former, for _Martel_'s
Company had deposed him, on Account, as they themselves told me, of his
Cruelty; had given him, and those who were willing to follow his
Fortunes, a Sloop, and, sending him away, chose a more righteous in his
Place, whose Name was _Kennedy_, by Descent an _Irishman_, by Birth a
_Spaniard_ of _Cuba_, and a Hunter. On my coming on Board the Pyrate,
Captain _Saunders_ of the _Weymouth_, who was taken the Day before, was
the first Man who spoke to me, telling me, he was sorry for my
Misfortune. I took him for the Commander of the Pyrate; but I soon found
my Mistake, by his carrying me aft to the Captain, who bid me welcome,
and drank to me in a Can of Wine; and some of the Crew told me, that it
was happy for me I did not fall into the Hands of their late Captain;
for a Ship with _Madera_ Wine thought fit to give them the Trouble to
lose some Time, and fire a couple of Chase-Guns before she shorten'd
Sail, which Captain _Martel_ took for so great an Affront, that all the
Company was cut off. But I shall now give you the Particulars of my
being taken. As I have said, I commanded the _Greyhound_ Galley, on
board of which I had 250 Slaves, bound from the Coast of _Guiney_ to
_Jamaica_, and consign'd to Messieurs _Feak_ and _Aldcroft_, on Account
of Mr. _Bignell_ and others. On the 16th of _October_ 1716, about 10
Leagues S. S. W. from the Island of _Monna_, in the grey of the Morning,
my second Mate came down and acquainted me, that a Ship was almost on
board us. We then steer'd about W. half South, and the Pyrate stood to
the S. E. His coming very near us made us edge away from him, and call
out to desire he would keep his Luff, or he would be on board us. No
Answer was given, and not a Soul appear'd on his Decks, but the Man at
the Helm, and about two more; however the _Greyhound_ got clear, and
crowded, as usual, for a Market. As soon as the Pyrate got into our
Wake, she wore, and made all the Sail she could, by which Means she soon
came up with us (for she was clean, and we foul) and clewing up her
Sprit-Sail, fir'd a Gun with Shot, and at the same Time let fly her
Jack, Ensign and Pendant, in which was the Figure of a Man, with a Sword
in his Hand, and an Hour-Glass before him, with a Death's Head and
Bones. In the Jack and Pendant were only the Head and Cross Bones. I did
not think fit to shorten Sail, which occasioned a second Shot from the
Pyrate, which went through our Main Top-Sail. Upon this I consulted my
Officers, and they advised the shortning Sail, as we were no Way in a
Capacity to make any Defence. I followed their Advice, and was order'd
on board the Pyrate, who ask'd me, pretty civily, the usual Questions,
Whence I came? Whether bound? _&c._ My second Mate, and some of my Men,
were soon shifted into the Pyrate, with 40 of the best Men Slaves; the
Women Slaves they diverted themselves with, and took off the Irons from
all the Negroes I had on board. The Captain asked me if I had no Gold? I
assured him I had not; and, indeed, I had no more than 100 Ounces,
which, before I went on board the Pyrate, my Carpenter had let into the
Ceiling of the great Cabbin. He answer'd only, it was very strange that
I should take no Gold on the Coast. I answer'd, I had taken a
considerable Quantity, but as I took it in one Place, I parted with it
in another; which, if he would inspect my Books, he would find exactly
as I said. We had no more Discourse then on the Subject, but a while
after, I and my Mate were sent for into the great Cabbin, where the
Council sat. Immediately cock'd Pistols were clapp'd to our Breasts, and
we were threaten'd with Death, in Case we did not confess what Gold we
had on board, and where it was hid. I deny'd that we had any, and
desir'd he would satisfy himself of the Truth, by examining my Books.
The Mate answer'd, he knew nothing of my Dealings on the Coasts, and
therefore could give no Answer. He knew, indeed, I had received Gold on
the Coast, as he had seen it brought on board; but he had seen a
considerable Quantity carry'd out of the Ship. Upon this, we were
order'd to withdraw, and nothing more was said; but I hearing their
Design was to torture me with lighted Matches between my Fingers, I
thought the Loss of the Use of my Hands would be but poorly compensated
with the saving 100 Ounces of Gold, and therefore desired to speak to
the Captain himself; to him I discover'd what I had, and where it was
concealed. He immediately sent his Boat on board the _Greyhound_, with
my Carpenter and half a dozen of his own Crew, who were so impatient to
be at the Gold, they made a meer Pincushion of the Fellow's Breech,
continually pricking his Backside with their Swords, to hasten him. My
Lodging was in the Hold, where one _Taffier_, the Gunner, came down to
me, and snapp'd a Pistol at my Breast, which he fired afterwards upon
Deck; and the same Man one Day, as I was on the Quarter-Deck, struck me,
in the Presence of his Captain, with his Cutlass, after having
reproach'd me with my private Confession, and asking, if every Man there
had not as good and just Pretension to the Gold as the Captain. Whether
it was by Accident or Design that he struck with the Flat of his
Cutlass, I know not, but the Blow knock'd me down, and depriv'd me of my
Senses for some Time.

Captain _Kennedy_, who seem'd to have more Humanity than is commonly
found in Men of his Profession, resented this Treatment of me so far,
that he got into his Yawl, and put off from the Ship, swearing he would
not sail with Men who so barbarously abused their Prisoners. He,
however, returned on board at their Perswasions, and on their Promise,
that nothing like it should happen for the future. The Night of the Day
in which we were taken, the Pyrate came to an Anchor under the Island of
_Savona_, where he kept us till the 20th, and then let us go in Company
with Captain _Saunders_, of the Ship _Weymouth_, from _Boston_, laden
with Fish and Lumber for _Jamaica_, at which Island we arrived and
anchor'd at _Port Royal_ the 25th in the Morning.

The Pyrate, a little before I was taken, had met with two interloping
_Dutch_ Men, supposed to be bound for the Main, who gave him a rough
Entertainment, and made him glad to sheer off.

The _Weymouth_ had two Women Passengers on board; how they pass'd their
Time I need not say; though, I fancy, as they had formerly made a Trip
or two to the Bay, there was no Rape committed.

Notwithstanding the melancholy Situation I was in, I could not refrain
laughing when I saw the Fellows who went on board the _Greyhound_,
return to their own Ship; for they had, in rummaging my Cabbin, met with
a Leather Powder Bag and Puff, with which they had powder'd themselves
from Head to Foot, walk'd the Decks with their Hats under their Arms,
minced their Oaths, and affected all the Airs of a Beau, with an
Aukwardness would have forced a Smile from a Cynick.

When I was permitted to return on board the _Greyhound_, and prosecute
my Voyage, I found all my Papers torn, and every Thing turn'd
topsy-turvy; but this was nothing to their leaving all my Negroes out of
Irons, of whom I was more in fear than I had been of the Pyrates; for,
among them, the Captain's Humanity protected us; but we could expect no
Quarter from the Negroes should they rebel; and, in such Case, we had no
Prospect of quelling them, for the Pyrates had taken away all our Arms,
and by opening a Cask of Knives, which they had scatter'd about the
Ship, they had armed the Negroes, one of whom had the Insolence to
collar and shake one of my Men. I therefore called my People aft, and
told them, our Security depended altogether on our Resolution; wherefore
arming selves with Handspikes, we drove the Negroes into the Hold, and
afterwards calling them up one by one, we put on their Irons, which the
Pyrates had not taken with them, took away their Knives, and, by these
Means, arrived safely at our Port. If this Detail is of any Service to
you, I have my Ends. I hope, if you intend a third Volume, it may induce
others who have had the same Misfortune of falling into the Hands of
Pyrates, to assist you with their Minutes.

                                                                 I am,
                                                                  SIR,
                                             Your very humble Servant,
                                                           _J. EVANS_.

_P.S._ Four of my Men took on with the Pyrates, though I remember the
Names of two only, _Bryant Ryley_, _John Hammond_.


                       _The TRIAL of the_ PYRATES
                            _at_ Providence.

                         _To Captain_ Johnson.

SIR,

As I am credibly informed you intend to oblige the Publick with a Second
Volume of _The Lives and Actions of the Pyrates_, and are now actually
collecting Matter; I was of Opinion, that the sending you some Minutes I
have by me, which are authentick, would be no unacceptable Office; and I
hope, the Gentleman who was then Governor of the _Bahama Islands_, will
not take the Publication of the following Tryals in ill Part, for I am
informed he is in Town. Before I would send them to you, I examined very
thoroughly whether he could have any Ground to be offended; but, as I
find them Marks of his Prudence and Resolution, and that in the
Condemnation and Execution of the Pyrates, he had a just Regard to the
publick Good, and was not to be deterr'd from vigorously pursuing it, in
Circumstances which would have intimidated many brave Men: I think the
Publication will do him both Honour and Justice, and therefore shall
make no Apology, but come to the Point.


      Trial and Condemnation of the Pyrates, who were executed at
     _Providence_, His Excellency _Woodes Rogers_, Esq; being then
       Captain General, Governor, and Vice-Admiral of the _Bahama
                               Islands_.

At a private Consultation, held on _Friday_ the 28th of _November_,
1718, at the _Secretary_'s Office in the City of _Nassau_.

New Providence _ss._

The Governor acquainting us, That Captain _Cockrem_ and Captain
_Hornigold_ have, by Virtue of a Commission, issued and directed to them
for the apprehending of certain Pyrates, had the Success to bring ten of
them Prisoners to this Part, who were now confined by an especial
_Mittimus_ on board the Ship _Delicia_; therefore, desired we might
agree to join in one Opinion concerning the said Prisoners ...... which
being maturely debated and considered, and that as the necessary Guards
set on the Prisoners for Want of a Goal, very much fatigued both the
Soldiers and Seamen, who equally guarded the Fort and Ship; and as many
as could be spar'd, daily work'd on the Fortifications, and did the Duty
of Centinels at Night, thereby harrassing our small Numbers of Men, and
hindering the publick Work. And there being suspected Persons still
remaining in these Islands, who may give frequent Intelligence of our
Condition; should any Fear be shewn on our Part, it might animate
several now here, to invite the Pyrates without, to attempt the Rescue
of these in Custody: Therefore, we do believe it most for the publick
Good, when the Fort is in a better State of Defence, and Captain
_Beauchamps_ and _Burgis_, with about 60 Soldiers and Seamen, at this
time gone to prevent the Designs of _Vane_ the Pyrate, are returned to
strengthen us: The Governor ought then as soon as possible
(notwithstanding he has made known to us, that he has no direct
Commission for Trial of Pyrates; yet according to the Intent and Meaning
of the sixth Article of the Governor's Instructions, which, in this
Case, refers to the fourth Article in those given to the Governor of
_Jamaica_, a Copy of whose Instructions he has for his Directions to
govern himself by, as near as the Circumstances of the Place will admit.
This corroborated with the Power in the Governor's Commission of
Governor, Captain General, and Vice-Admiral of the _Bahama Islands_,
shew the Intention of his Majesty, for such Authority here; and having
an Account that the Proprietory Government of _Carolina_ had executed 22
Pyrates, lately carried in there, which together with the provoking ill
Example and Behaviour of these Prisoners, who have all accepted his
Majesty's Act of Grace, and afterwards turned Pyrates again, and
considering it would be a great Risque and Trouble to send so many to
_Great Britain_, and much greater to keep them Prisoners here; we are
entirely of Opinion, his Majesty will approve of the Necessity for the
Governor's judicial Proceeding with these Pyrates, by a Trial in the
best Manner we can according to Law; and do verily believe the speediest
Execution for those who shall be found guilty, will conduce most to the
Welfare of this Government.

_N. B._ Thus this stands in the Council-Book, the Governor's Secretary
is answerable for Want of Connexion, or the Secretary of the Islands;
for I cannot find what these Words can refer to, _the Governor ought
then as soon as possible_, what ought he? But may be, it is an Error in
my Friend, who himself brought over this Copy, written in his own Hand,
which with the following, I found among his Papers after his Decease.


    His Excellency _Woodes Rogers_, Esq; Captain-General, Governor,
               and Vice-Admiral of the _Bahama Islands_.

The Prisoners holding up their Hands, and the Accusation being read, all
the said Prisoners were asked by the Register, Whether Guilty, or, Not

Ordered, That the Evidence for the King be severally sworn and examined.


                              James Kerr.

The Examination of _James Kerr_, Gent. upon Oath saith, That he being
Supercargo in Trust, and outward bound from _Providence_, a trading
Voyage in the Sloop _Mary_, and in about two Days Sail from the said
Island, did arrive at _Green Key_ with two other Vessels in Company,
bound also on the said trading Account, where, on the 6th of _October_
last, one _Phineas Bunce_, one of the said Vessel's Company, and the
head Mutineer of the Pyrates now at the Bar, but since deceas'd, did
then and there come on board the said Sloop _Mary_, and very vilely
treat this Deponent, and in the Evening did turn the Deponent ashore
upon the said _Green Key_, a desolate Island; and this Deponent farther
saith, that _Dennis Mackarthy_, one of the Prisoners now at the Bar, was
the only Person of all the said Pyrates and Mutineers who shew'd this
Deponent any civil Treatment, and that the said _Mackarthy_ did not
reflect on the King and Government as others of them now at the Bar did,
in this Deponent's Hearing.


                             Wm. Greenaway.

The Examination of Captain _William Greenaway_ upon Oath saith, That on
the 6th of _October_ last _John Hipps_, one of the Prisoners now at the
Bar, with some others of them, came on board the Vessel under this
Deponent's Command, and then riding at _Green Key_, with Pretensions of
getting Tobacco, and told this Deponent, that Mr. _Kerr_ had a Mind to
sail that Night; and this Deponent having order'd his Boat to go on
board the Scooner, then belonging to the said Company, to give them
Notice of the said _Kerr_'s Design; in which Interim came on board _John
Augur_ and _George Rounsivel_, both Prisoners now at the Bar, _James
Matthews_ and _John Johnson_, who wanted this Deponent to go on board
the Scooner, which he did, where _Phineas Bunce_, since dead, met this
Deponent at the Side; upon which, this Deponent demanded of the said
_Bunce_, the Reason he did not prepare for sailing, as the rest did.
Whereupon _Bunce_, the head Mutineer, asked this Deponent to walk down
into the Cabbin, and, when there, _Bunce_ asked him to sit down by him;
whereupon the said _Bunce_ told this Deponent, he was his Prisoner; upon
which, _Dennis Macarthey_, now Prisoner at the Bar, presented a Pistol
at this Deponent's Breast, and told him, if he spoke a Word, he, this
Deponent, was a dead Man; and the said _Phineas Bunce_ told this
Deponent, he had best be easy, for that the better Part of the People
belonging to the Sloop _Mary_ was on his Side, as were some of the
People he had with him. And then the said _Phineas Bunce_, with others,
the Mutineers, went on board the Sloop _Mary_, and took her. But this
Deponent cannot particularize the Names of the Men who were with
_Bunce_, being Night-time. Afterwards the said _Bunce_, and the
Prisoners now at the Bar, except _John Hipps_, put Mr. _James Kerr_,
_Richard Turnly_, _Thomas Rich_, _John Taylor_, and _John Cox_, all
ashore at _Green Key_, a desolate Island, and had the Boat ready
prepared to carry this Deponent ashore also; but _Bunce_ hereupon
declared, that this Deponent, being a _Bermudian_, would swim aboard
again, and therefore confin'd this Deponent a Prisoner, and plundered
his Vessel, leaving him not wherewithal to proceed any where, but a
small Quantity of Flower and Beef, obliging this Deponent not to sail
from _Green Key_ in 24 Hours after his Departure; but this Deponent did
sail the next Morning for _Providence_, and, in his Way, fell in Sight
of the said Mutineers and Pyrates, of whom the Prisoners at the Bar were
some, who gave Chase. Whereupon this Deponent went back to _Green Key_,
and took to the Shore, where he saw the Pyrates and said Mutineers cut
away the Mast of this Deponent's Vessel, and then were coming on Shore,
as this Deponent apprehended, to take his Person. Whereupon this
Deponent made his Escape to hide himself from them upon the said _Key_.
Then the People who were left on board this Deponent's Vessel, coming
ashore, told this Deponent, that the Pyrates had scuttled her, turn'd
the Yawl adrift, and from _Green Key_ the said Pyrates proceeded to
_Stocking_ Island, where meeting the _Spaniards_, the Pyrates were
themselves taken, and put ashore.


                              John Taylor.

The Examination of _John Taylor_ upon Oath saith, That all the Prisoners
at the Bar, except _John Hipps_, did join with _Bunce_, the Mutineer;
and that _Bunce_ and two more, whom the Deponent knew not, being Night,
took the Vessel he belong'd to; and further saith, That _John Hipps_ was
at first confined with the said _Greenaway_ by _Bunce_.


                            Richard Turnly.

The Examination of _Richard Turnly_ upon Oath saith, That on the 6th of
_October_ last, _Bunce_ the head Mutineer and two others, naming
_William Dowling_ and _Thomas Morris_, Prisoners at the Bar, did come on
board the Sloop _Mary_ at _Green Key_, and ask'd Mr. _Kerr_ and this
Deponent for a Bottle of Beer, which was given them, and afterwards a
Second, and they commanded a third; and then with the Men, belonging to
the said Sloop _Mary_, took up Arms, and took Mr. _Kerr_, _Thomas Cox_,
and this Deponent Prisoners, and forced them to go on Shore at _Green
Key_, a desolate Island, about 25 Leagues distant from _Providence_.


                               John Cox.

The Examination of _John Cox_ upon Oath saith, That he being on board
the Sloop _Mary_, of which _John Augur_ went out of _Providence_ Master:
The said _John Augur_ came on board his said Sloop in the Evening of the
6th Day of _October_ last, and lay down as if he designed to sleep. Soon
after, Capt. _Greenaway_, Master of the Sloop _Lancaster_, came on
board, and ask'd the said _Augur_, if he intended to set Sail? He
answer'd, he could not tell; thereupon Captain _Greenaway_ went on board
the Scooner, call'd the _Batchelor's Adventure_, _Henry White_, Master,
and in about half an Hour afterwards, came on board another Boat with
_John Hipps_, _Greenaway_'s Boatswain, to enquire for Captain
_Greenaway_; and in a little Time after, _Phineas Bunce_ came on board
the Sloop _Mary_ from the _Scooner_ with 2 or 3 Men more. _Bunce_ ask'd
for Captain _Augur_, and whether they had any Thing to drink, and coming
to Mr. _Kerr_, ask'd him for a Bottle of Beer, which Mr. _Kerr_ gave
him; then the said _Bunce_ went into the Cabbin, and brought up a
Cutlash, and stood at the Cabbin-Door to drink, and swore that he was
Captain of that Vessel, and would be so, which made Captain _Augur_ ask
him his Meaning; but presently the said _Bunce_ and _Augur_ seem'd to be
good Friends, and _Bunce_ ask'd for another Bottle of Beer, then struck
Mr. _Kerr_ with a Cutlash on his Back, and turn'd him and others ashore;
and this Deponent well knew all the several Prisoners at the Bar, except
_Hipps_ the Boatswain, and that all the rest were Aiders, Assistants,
and Abettors to the Mutiny, Felony, and Pyracy, committed upon the
Vessels and Cargoes at _Green Key_.


                              Thomas Rich.

The Examination of _Thomas Rich_ upon Oath saith, That he knows the
several Prisoners at the Bar; and that they all, except _Hipps_, were
the Actors of the Mutiny and Pyracy, committed upon the Vessels and
Cargoes at _Green Key_; and this Deponent was taken by them in the
_Mary_ Sloop, and put ashore with Mr. _Kerr_ and the other Evidences for
the King.


                             Thomas Petty.

The Examination of _Thomas Petty_ upon Oath saith, That he saw _Hipps_
beat by _Bunce_, and believes he was forced to go with him; and that
_Bunce_ would have forc'd this Deponent also; but _Dennis Mackarthy_,
Prisoner at the Bar, said if _Bunce_ forc'd the Deponent, he the said
Prisoner would leave _Bunce_ and his Company.

And then the Court adjourn'd till 3 a-Clock in the Afternoon.

The Court being met according to Adjournment, and all the Evidences for
the King being called and examined, then the Prisoners at the Bar were
severally called, to know what Defence each had to make, _viz._


                              John Augur.

_John Augur_ being first called to make Defence for himself, saith no
other than that he was in Liquor, and knew not of _Phineas Bunce_ his
Design, when the said _Bunce_ enter'd on board the Sloop _Mary_, whereof
the Prisoner was Master; but could call no Evidence to prove himself not
guilty.


                            Wm. Cunningham.

_William Cunningham_ being next called and examined said, That he was
asleep when _Bunce_ went on board the _Scooner_ (to which the Prisoner
belong'd) at _Green Key_, and that _Bunce_ brought the said Prisoner
Punch, and told him, that he the Prisoner must either join him the said
_Bunce_, or be put upon a _Moroon Key_, _alias_ a desolate Key.


                              John Hipps.

_John Hipps_, Prisoner, said in his Defence, that he did not in any wise
enter with _Bunce_ and his Company; but went on board the aforesaid
_Scooner_, to enquire for _William Greenaway_ his Captain, where he was
immediately confined by _Bunce_, together with _Greenaway_, and
afterwards put on Shore with Mr. _Kerr_ and others, where _Bunce_ beat
the said Prisoner, and compell'd him at length to join _Bunce_, but
nevertheless declared his Intention to leave the said _Bunce_ and
Company on the first Opportunity, and desired Mr. _Kerr_, Captain
_Greenaway_, _Richard Turnly_, _Thomas Terrell_, _Benjamin Hutchins_,
_John Taylor_, _John Janson_, _Thomas Petty_ and _David Meredith_, might
be examin'd for him.

Mr. _James Kerr_ being sworn as Evidence for the Prisoner declared, That
_Bunce_ used much threatning Language against _John Hipps_, Prisoner,
that if he did not join him the said _Bunce_ and pyratical Company, and
go with them into a Boat, provided on Purpose to carry the Pyrates to
their Rendezvous, _Hipps_ should repent the Refusal; and farther says,
that he saw or knew of no Blows given to compel the Prisoner to assist
or join the said Pyrates, but that the Prisoner afterwards accepted the
Office and Command of Boatswain to the said pyratical Company.

Captain _Greenaway_ being sworn for the Prisoner says, that the Prisoner
went with him on board the _Scooner_, and was in the Cabbin with him,
and made Prisoner with him on board the said _Scooner_, where the
Prisoner made Proposal to the Deponent to surprize _Dennis Mackarthy_,
Prisoner at the Bar, then a Centinel upon Deck, and throw the said
_Mackarthy_ over-board; but the Deponent seeing no Probability of
escaping the Rest, advised the Prisoner to keep his Mind to himself,
till he could have a better Opportunity; and farther saith, that the
Prisoner was put ashore with Mr. _Kerr_, &c.

_Richard Turnly_ being sworn for the Prisoner deposed, That to the best
of his Knowledge and Remembrance, the Prisoner was forc'd to accept of
any Duty the said _Bunce_ and Company put upon him, if the Command of
Words be allowed by the Court sufficient to excuse him; but he never saw
_Bunce_, or any of the rest of the Pyrates, use Blows to force him to
join them.

_Thomas Terrell_, Inhabitant, being sworn, gave the Prisoner the
Character of being an honest Man, who was recommended to him by _Thomas
Bowling_, Master of the Sloop _Sarah_, belonging to the said _Thomas
Terrell_, that during a late Voyage perform'd to _Cuba_, about two
Months ago, there was a Mutiny suspected by _Thomas Bowling_, of which
the said _Bowling_ declared, that _John Hipps_ Prisoner, was not only
innocent, but believed a Suppressor of the said Mutiny; and farther
declares, that _Thomas Bowling_ had acknowledged the Safety of the
Vessel to be much owing to _John Hipps_, Prisoner at the Bar.

_Benjamin Hutchins_ being sworn for the Prisoner, and examined,
declared, that the Prisoner after having been matriculated and seduced
by _Bunce_ and his Accomplices, often complain'd to him the Deponent,
that he would desert them the first Opportunity, and shew'd his
Intentions by many Tears shed, as Tokens of Sorrow for his late
Misfortune.

_John Taylor_ being examined upon Oath declared, that the Prisoner was
confined as a Person not trusted by _Bunce_ and his pyratical Company.

_John Jansen_ being examined upon Oath, had nothing to declare for or
against the Prisoner worth Notice.

_Thomas Petty_ being sworn for the Prisoner declared, that _Bunce_
threatned the Prisoner, that if he would not consent to be of his
pyratical Company, he should be frequently beat; and also be put on the
first _Moroon Key_, where he might not find Provision, Water, or any
other Sustenance, which the Deponent thinks compell'd the Prisoner to
proceed with _Bunce_ for his Safety.

_David Meredith_ being also examined upon Oath declared, That when
_Phineas Bunce_ first made Seizure of the Vessel, he particularly spoke
to _Hipps_ the Prisoner, that if he would not take on in their Way, he
the said _Bunce_ would moroon him, upon some desolate Key or Island; and
the more to compel him, gave him several Blows with his Cutlash, and
thinks the Prisoner was forced to join with _Bunce_, &c.


                           Dennis Mackarthy.

_Dennis Mackarthy_ Prisoner being next called, and desiring that Mr.
_Kerr_, Captain _Greenaway_, _John Taylor_, _Thomas Rich_, and _Thomas
Petty_, might be admitted to give Evidence for him.

Mr. _Kerr_ being examined upon Oath declared, That _Mackarthy_,
Prisoner, was as active as any other of the Prisoners in their pyratical
Designs, and has nothing more to speak in his Favour, than that the
Prisoner treated him and all others that were of the Deponent's Company,
with more Civility than any others of the pyratical Crew did.

Captain _Greenaway_ being sworn for the Prisoner declared, That when
_Bunce_ beat the said Deponent, the Prisoner said, that he would see who
ought to be Strikers amongst them for the future.

_John Taylor_ being examined upon Oath declares, that the Prisoner
should say, that he would leave _Bunce_ and his Accomplices.

_Thomas Rich_ being sworn declares, that he heard the Prisoner say, that
since he had begun, he thought himself obliged to go on with them,
meaning _Bunce_ and his pyratical Company.

_Thomas Petty_ being also sworn declares, That after _Mackarthy_ had
been an Accomplice of _Bunce_'s Pyracy, he heard the Prisoner say, he
was sorry for his Unadvisedness, which might bring great Troubles on his
poor Wife, having a small Child.


                           George Rounsivel.

_George Rounsivel_, Prisoner, being next called, desired _Turnly_ to be
Evidence for him; who being sworn, declared, That _Geo. Rounsivel_,
after having consented to be of _Bunce_'s pyratical Company, shew'd some
Token of Sorrow, but withal said, that as he had begun, could not
without Danger of Life, desert the Pyrates he had combined with.


                              Wm. Dowling.

_William Dowling_, Prisoner, being next called, and desiring _Thomas
Petty_ to be Evidence for him, he was sworn, and said, that he had very
little to say for him, because he had seen the Prisoner as consenting to
their pyratical Designs as any of the said Prisoners.


                             William Lewis.

_William Lewis_, Prisoner, being next called, had very little to say for
himself, otherwise than that one _David Meredith_ had heard him say, he
wished to be at _John Cullemore_'s House to drink a Bottle of Beer,
which _David Meredith_, being sworn as Evidence for the Prisoner, only
confirmed.


                             Thomas Morris.

_Thomas Morris_, Prisoner, being next called, had very little else to
say, than that he had the Fever and Ague when he was first commanded by
_Bunce_ to join them, and desiring _Thomas Rich_ as Evidence, he was
sworn, and declared, that the Prisoner, as much as he took Notice of
him, appeared as active as the most capable, and could not say, that the
Prisoner ever relented.


                            George Bendall.

_George Bendall_, Prisoner, being next called, and desiring _Richard
Turnly_ for Evidence, he was sworn, and declared, that the Prisoner was

                             William Ling.

_William Ling_, Prisoner, being next called, who having nothing to say
farther, than a Request that _Richard Turnly_ might give in Evidence for
him; he was sworn, and declared, that the Prisoner bore Arms, and was as
resolved as any of the Pyrates.

Then the Court adjourned till Ten a-Clock next Morning, being the 10th
Instant.

                                                  _December_ 10, 1718.

The Court having met according to the Adjournment, and Proclamation
made, the Prisoners were again brought to the Bar, and severally ask'd,
if they had considered of any farther Evidence or Defence they could
propose.

First, _John Augur_ had no more to offer, in his Justification than
before.

The second, _William Cunningham_, the same as before.

The Third, _John Hipps_ having the same Question put, answer'd, that if
_John Raddon_ and _Henry White_ had not been absent, they could have
declared many Things in his Favour.

Then the Court proposed to every Person, who was an Auditor of the
Trial, that any might have Leave to declare upon Oath, any Thing they
had heard _John Raddon_ or _Henry White_ say in Behalf of _John Hipps_,
Prisoner: Upon which, _Samuel Lawford_, Constable, appear'd, and being
sworn, declared, That he heard _George Raddon_ say, that he should have
been glad to have done the old Boatswain any Service, meaning _Hipps_,
the Prisoner at the Bar; for the said _Raddon_ had seen him cry for his
having consented, tho' by Force, to join _Bunce_, &c. the Prisoner
having also declared to _Raddon_, that he would fight each of the
Pyrates singly, if he could by that Means get clear of them. This
Deponent farther said, that _Raddon_ told him, he firmly believed the
Prisoner at the Bar would have escaped from the other Pyrates, as soon
as he could have got an Opportunity.

The Fourth, _Dennis Mackarthy_, Prisoner, made some faint Excuse, and at
length desired Captain _Benjamin Hornigold_, as farther Evidence for
him; who being sworn, declared, That when he the said _Hornigold_ went
to apprehend the Prisoners, who were on one of the _Exuma_ Keys, he the
said Prisoner was one of the first taken, and seem'd to the said
_Hornigold_ to throw himself, and to have Dependance, on the Mercy of
the Governor.

The Fifth, _George Rounsivel_, Prisoner, had no farther Plea to make.

The Sixth, _William Dowling_, Prisoner, only desired _Thomas Petty_ to
be again call'd, who being sworn, only declared, That he the Prisoner
had Offers made by the _Spaniards_ to go in their Service, but the
Prisoner refused them.

The Seventh, _William Lewis_ desired _Richard Turnley_ might be again
called, who being sworn, declared, That he the Deponent did not see the
said Prisoner when the Sloop _Mary_ was first taken, but the Day after
he saw the Prisoner under Arms, as active as any one of the Pyrates.

The Eighth, _Thomas Morris_, Prisoner, had little more to say than
pretending that several Persons who were absent, would say something in
his Justification; but no one present declared any Thing in his Favour.

The Ninth, _George Bendall_, Prisoner, had nothing to plead for himself;
but desiring Mr. _Kerr_ for Evidence, he was sworn, and declared, That
he heard the Prisoner say, that he wish'd he had begun the Life sooner,
for he thought it a pleasant One, meaning that of a Pyrate; and farther
deposed, that the Prisoner reported, that he had once a strong
Inclination to have smother'd _John Graves_, Esq; his Majesty's
Collector for the Islands, as he lay feeble in his Bed, whose Servant
the Prisoner was, but a short Time before he shipp'd himself for the
intended Voyage, when he join'd the other Prisoners at the Bar in their
Mutiny and Pyracy.

_David Meredith_ being also sworn, declared, That _Bunce_ did once beat
the Prisoner, who told him, that if _Bunce_, &c. beat him once more, he
would desert them the first Opportunity.

The Tenth, _William Ling_ had nothing farther to say for himself.

Then the Prisoners were remanded to the Fort; after which, all Manner of
Persons were commanded by Proclamation to withdraw.

Then the Court summ'd up the Evidences for the King and the Prisoners,
which being debated and considered, all the Prisoners, except _John
Hipps_, were unanimously voted guilty of their Indictment, and the
Register was ordered to draw up their Sentence. It was thought
convenient to respite the Judgment on _John Hipps_, Prisoner, till
_Monday_ next; and the Court adjourn'd till Four this Afternoon, at
which Time being met according to Adjournment, and Proclamation made,
the Prisoners were brought to the Bar. Then _John Hipps_ was remanded to
the Guardship in Irons, and all the rest asked, if they knew any Cause
why Sentence of Death should not be pronounced against them? They had
nothing more to say, but to desire some Length of Time for Repentance.


                Then the Sentence was read, as follows:

The Court having duly considered of the Evidence which hath been given
both for and against you the said _John Augur_, _William Cunningham_,
_Dennis Mackarthy_, _Geo. Rounsivel_, _Wm Dowling_, _Wm Lewis_, _Tho.
Morris_, _Geo. Bendall_ and _Wm Ling_; and having also debated the
several Circumstances of the Cases, it is adjudged, that you the said
_John Augur_, _Wm Cunningham_, _Dennis Mackarthy_, _Geo. Rounsivel_, _Wm
Dowling_, _Wm Lewis_, _Tho. Morris_, _Geo. Bendall_ and _Wm Ling_, are
guilty of the Mutiny, Felony, and Pyracy, wherewith you and every of you
stand accused. And the Court doth accordingly pass Sentence, that you
the said _John Augur_, _Wm. Cunningham_, _Dennis Mackarthy_, _Geo.
Rounsivel_, _Wm. Dowling_, _Wm. Lewis_, _Tho. Morris_, _Geo. Bendall_
and _Wm. Ling_, be carried to Prison from whence you came, and from
thence to the Place of Execution, where you are to be hanged by the Neck
till you shall be dead, dead, dead; and God have Mercy on your Souls.
Given under our Hands this 10th Day of _October, Annoq; Dom._ 1718,
sign'd

   _Woodes Rogers_,
   _Wm Fairfax_,
   _Robert Beauchamp_,
   _Thomas Walker_,
   _Wingate Gale_,
   _Nathaniel Taylor_,
   _Josias Burgiss_,
   _Peter Courant_.

After Sentence of Death pass'd upon the Prisoners, the Governor, as
President of the Court, appointed their Execution to be at Ten a-Clock
on _Friday_ next in the Morning being the 12th Instant.

Whereupon the Prisoners pray'd for longer Time to repent and prepare for
Death; but the Governor told them, that from the Time of their being
apprehended, which was on the 15th of _November_, they ought to have
accounted themselves as condemn'd by the Laws of all Nations, which was
only sealed now; and that the securing them hitherto, and the Favour
that the Court had allowed them in making as long a Defence as they
could, wholly took up that Time, which the Affairs of the Settlement
required in working at the Fortifications; besides the Fatigue thereby
occasion'd to the whole Garrison in the necessary Guards, set over them
by the Want of a Goal, and the Garrison having been very much lessened
by Death and Sickness since his Arrival; also that he was obliged to
employ all his People to assist in mounting the great Guns, and in
finishing the present Works, with all possible Dispatch, because of the
expected War with _Spain_; and there being many more Pyrates amongst
these Islands, and this Place left destitute of all Relief from any Man
of War or Station Ship, much wanted, join'd to other Reasons he had, too
long to enumerate in Court, he thought himself indispensably obliged,
for the Welfare of the Settlement, to give them no longer Time.

Then the Prisoners were ordered to the Place of their Imprisonment in
the Fort, where Leave was given them to send for any Persons to read and
pray with them.

On _Friday_ Morning each of the Prisoners were call'd in private, to
know if they had any Load upon their Spirits, for Actions committed as
yet unknown to the World, the declaring of which was absolutely
required, to prepare themselves for a fit Repentance; but they each
refused to declare any Thing, as well as making known to the Governor,
if they knew of any Conspiracy against the Government.

Wherefore, about Ten a-Clock, the Prisoners were releas'd of their
Irons, and committed to the Charge and Care of _Thomas Robinson_, Esq;
commissioned Provost Marshal for the Day, who, according to custom in
such Cases, pinion'd them, _&c._ and order'd the Guards appointed to
assist him, to lead them to the Top of the Rampart, fronting the Sea,
which was well guarded by the Governor's Soldiers and People, to the
Number of about 100. At the Prisoners Request, several select Prayers
and Psalms were read, in which all present join'd; when the Service was
ended, Orders was given to the Marshal, and he conducted the Prisoners
down a Ladder, provided on Purpose, to the Foot of the Wall, where was a
Gallows erected, and a black Flag hoisted thereon, and under it a Stage,
supported by three Butts, on which they ascended by another Ladder,
where the Hangman fasten'd the Cords. They had three Quarters of an Hour
allowed under the Gallows, which was spent by them in singing of Psalms,
and some Exhortations to their old Consorts, and the other Spectators,
who got as near to the Foot of the Gallows as the Marshal's Guard would
suffer them. When the Governor ordered the Marshal to make ready, and
all the Prisoners expecting the Launch, the Governor thought fit to
order _George Rounsivel_ to be untied, and when brought off the Stage,
the Buts having Ropes about them, were hawl'd away; upon which, the
Stage fell, and the Prisoners were suspended.


               A short Account of the Prisoners executed.

First, _John Augur_, being about 40 Years of Age, had been a noted
Master of Vessels at _Jamaica_, and since among the Pyrates; but on his
accepting of his Majesty's Act of Grace, and Recommendations to the
Governor, he was, notwithstanding, entrusted with a good Vessel and
Cargo, in which betraying his Trust, and knowing himself guilty of the
Indictment, he all along appeared very penitent, and neither wash'd,
shav'd, or shifted his old Cloaths, when carried to be executed; and
when he had a small Glass of Wine given him on the Rampart, drank it
with Wishes for the good Success of the _Bahama_ Islands and the
Governor.

The Second, _William Cunningham_, aged 45, had been Gunner with _Thatch_
the Pyrate, who being also conscious of his own Guilt, was seemingly
penitent, and behaved himself as such.

The Third, _Dennis Mackarthy_, aged 28, who had also been formerly a
Pyrate, but accepted of the King's Act of Grace; and the Governor had
made him an Ensign of the Militia, being recommended as a sober
civiliz'd Person, which Commission he had at the Time of his joining the
Pyrates, which very much aggravated his other Crimes. During his
Imprisonment, he behaved himself tolerably well; but when he thought he
was to die, and the Morning came, without his expected Reprieve, he
shifted his Cloaths, and wore long blue Ribbons at his Neck, Wrists,
Knees, and Cap; and when on the Rampart, look'd cheerfully round him,
saying, _He knew the Time when there were many brave Fellows on the
Island, who would not have suffered him to die like a Dog_; and at the
same Time pull'd off his Shooes, kicking them over the Parapet of the
Fort, saying, _He had promis'd not to die with his Shooes on_; so
descended the Fort Wall, and ascended the Stage, with as much Agility
and in a Dress of a Prize-Fighter; when mounted, he exhorted the People,
who were at the Foot of the Walls, to have Compassion on him, but,
however willing, they saw too much Power over their Heads to attempt any
Thing in his Favour.

The Fourth, _William Dowling_, of about 24 Years of Age, had been a
considerable Time amongst the Pyrates, of a wicked Life, which his
Majesty's Act of Grace did not reform; his Behaviour was very loose on
the Stage, and after his Death, some of his Acquaintance declared, he
had confess'd to them, that he had murder'd his Mother before he left
_Ireland_.

The Fifth, _William Lewis_, aged about 34 Years, as he had been a hardy
Pyrate and Prize Fighter, affected an Unconcern at Death; but heartily
desired Liquors to drink with his Sufferers on the Stage, and with the
Standers by.

The Sixth, _Thomas Morris_, aged about 22, had been a very incorrigible
Youth and Pyrate, and seem'd to have very little Anxiety of Mind by his
frequent Smiles when at the Bar, being dress'd with red Ribbons as
_Mackarthy_ was with blue, he said, going over the Ramparts, _We have a
new Governor, but a harsh One_; and a little before he was turn'd off,
said aloud, _that he might have been a greater Plague to these Islands,
and now wish'd he had been so_.

The Sixth, _George Bendall_, aged about 18, tho' he said, _he had never
been a Pyrate before, yet he had all the villainous Inclinations that
the most profligate Youth could be infected with_; his Behaviour was
sullen.

The Eighth, _William Ling_, aged about 30, not taken Notice of before
the last Attempt, behaved himself as becoming a true Penitent, and was
not heard to say any other than by Reply to _Lewis_, when he demanded
Wine to drink, _that Water was more suitable to them at that Time_.

It was observed that there were but few (beside the Governor's
Adherents) among the Spectators, who had not deserved the same Fate, but
pardon'd by his Majesty's Act of Grace.


                           _Of Captain_ VANE.

We have given what Account came to our Hands of _Charles Vane_ in the
first Volume, beginning at the Time he left _Providence_ on the
Governor's Arrival; but we have since had some Particulars sent us,
which relate to Pyracies, both before and after that Date.

In the latter End of _March_ 1718, he, with about 12 more lewd Fellows,
who had squander'd all their Money got by former Villanies, took a
Canoe, and went out on the old Account. Soon after their setting out
they made Prize of a Sloop belonging to _Jamaica_, brought her into
_Potters Key_, where they came to an Anchor, and put all the Hands on
Shore, except the Master, to whom they promis'd to return his Sloop as
soon as they met with another more fit for their Purpose; which soon
after happen'd, for cruizing off _Harbour Island_ in the beginning of
_April_, they took the _Lark_ Sloop, which had been taken from the
Pyrates by Captain _Pierce_, in the _Phoenix_ Man of War, who fitted her
out with a Cargo to trade at St. _Augustin_'s. He brought his Prize into
_Providence_ Harbour, with his black Ensign hoisted, in Defiance of the
above named Man of War, which he loudly threaten'd to burn. _Vane_, at
_Providence_, augmented his Number of Men to 75, sailed in search of
Booty, and on the 4th of _July_ return'd with a _French_ Ship of 20
Guns, a _French_ Brigantine laden with Sugar, Indigo, Brandy, Claret,
White Wine, and other Merchandize; the _Drake_ Sloop, _John Draper_,
Master, which he took in his Passage from _Providence_ to _Harbour_
Island, and plunder'd of a considerable Sum of Money, shifting into her
some Sugars out of the _French_ Brigantine; the _Ulster_ Sloop, _John
Fredd_, Master, laden with Timber from _Andros_ Island, into this Vessel
he put 70 Casks of Sugar; and the _Eagle_ Sloop, _Robert Brown_, Master,
bound to _South-Carolina_, which he took with a two-masted Boat,
commanded by _Edward England_, his Quarter Master; he put on board this
last 20 Terses of Sugar, 6 of Bread, and some other Things. In the
Harbour he seized on the _Lancaster_ Sloop, _Neal Walker_, Master, and
the _Dove_ Sloop, _William Harris_, Master, designed for _Jamaica_,
which he plunder'd of what he thought proper, and shifted 22 Hogsheads
of Sugar, some _Spanish_ Hides and old Rigging.

He had the Impudence to come ashore with his Sword in Hand, threaten to
burn the principal Houses of the Town, and to make Examples of many of
the People; and though he committed no Murders, his Behaviour was
extreamly insolent to all who were not as great Villains as himself. He
reign'd here as Governor 20 Days, stopp'd all Vessels which came in, and
would suffer none to go out, being inform'd of a Governor being sent
from _England_, he swore, while he was in the Harbour, he would suffer
no other Governor than himself. He clean'd and fitted the _French_ Ship,
with Intent to visit the Coast of _Brazil_, and design'd to sail in 3 or
4 Days; but the Governor appearing on the 24th, made him change his
Resolution, and think of accepting a Pardon, if it might be granted on
his own Terms, as will appear by the Letter which he sent off by a Boat
to the Governor, and of which the following is an exact Copy.

                                                _July_ the 24th, 1718.

'Your Excellency may please to understand that we are willing to accept
his Majesty's most gracious Pardon on the following Terms, _viz._

'That you will suffer us to dispose of all our Goods now in our
Possession. Likewise, to act as we think fit with every Thing belonging
to us, as his Majesty's Act of Grace specifies.

'If your Excellency shall please to comply with this, we shall, with all
Readiness, accept of his Majesty's Act of Grace. If not, we are obliged
to stand on our Defence. So conclude

                                                 Your humble Servants,
                                         _Charles Vane_, and Company.'

The Susperscription was--

          To his Excellency the Governor of _New Providence_.

And at the Bottom of it.--We wait a speedy Answer.

                   *       *       *       *       *

The Governor could not get in that Night, but was forced to keep at Sea,
so that Mr. _Vane_ could not so speedily have an Answer as his
Excellency design'd, which he intended to carry himself. About Four that
Afternoon the _Rose_ Man of War and _Shark_ Sloop got in, and were
saluted with four Shot from _Vane_, which, however, did no other Damage
than the cutting the _Rose_'s Rigging. In the Evening Captain _Whitney_
sent his Lieutenant on Board _Vane_, who was higher up the Harbour in
the _French_ Ship. They detained this Gentleman two Hours, and the Crew,
most of which was drunk, treated him, some with Threats, shewing the
black Flag, and some with Contempt and Ridicule, and order'd him back to
tell his Captain their Resolution was to fight it out to the last.

When Captain _Whitney_ fired the eight a-Clock Gun, _Vane_ did the like
with Shot, directed at the _Rose_. At Ten he pointed all the Guns of the
_French_ Ship (double loaded) at the Man of War, and, after setting Fire
to her, went with 40 Hands into a Sloop belonging to one _Yates_. As the
_French_ Man burnt, the Guns fired, and cut some more of the _Rose_'s
Rigging. Captain _Whitney_ apprehending Danger from the fir'd Ship,
together with the _Shark_ Sloop, cut and put out to Sea, which gave
_Vane_ an Opportunity he laid hold on, to take what he thought fit off
Shore, and to force the best Carpenter and Pilot in the Island on Board
him. When he had done, he went to, and lay at _Potters Key_ all Night,
and the next Morning got under Sail.

His Excellency dispatch'd after him the _Buck_ Sloop and another small
one, both well mann'd and fitted, which gain'd while he was upon a Wind,
and came, before he clear'd the East End of the Island, within Gun-Shot;
but he easing out his Main-Sheet, and setting his Flying-Jibb, left them
soon after; wherefore, Night coming on, and their Pursuit being
fruitless, they return'd.

Soon after _Vane_ sent the Governor of _Providence_ Word, he would make
him a Visit, and burn his Guardship, for sending two Sloops to chase him
instead of answering his Letter.

The 30th of _August_ he took the _Neptune_ of 400 Tuns, and the
_Emperor_ of 200 Tuns, the Particulars of which are in the subjoin'd
Protest.

The 9th of _September_ he arrived at _Allens Key_ in a _Spanish_
Brigantine; he had before taken a _Spanish_ Ship of the _Havanna_; here
he forced on Board a Pilot, took a Sloop and went to _Green Turtle Key_.

I have only to add: This Pyrate, whose Death is set down in the first
Volume, betray'd the Coward when at the Gallows, and died in Agonies
equal to his Villainies, which he gave no Ground to believe proceeded
from the Apprehensions of a future State, but the Fear of Death. He
shew'd not the least Remorse for the Crimes of his past Life, which was
taken Notice of by the Spectators of his deserved Punishment, and told
me by a worthy Gentleman who saw Justice done on him at _Gallows Point_
on _Port Royal_.


       The Protest of Captain _King_, Commander of the _Neptune_
                                Hagboat.

'By this publick Instrument of Protest be it made known and manifest,
that on the 30th Day of _August_ 1718, _John King_, lately Commander of
the _Neptune_ Hagboat of _London_, but now in the Island of
_Providence_, one of his Majesty's _Bahama_ Islands, came before me
_Woodes Rogers_, Esq; Governor, _&c._ and declared to me, that on the
Day and Date above-written, he sailed with the said Ship _Neptune_
Hagboat over the Bar of _Carolina_, in Company with three more Ships
bound for _London_, _viz._ the _Emperor_, Captain _Arnold Powers_,
Commander, and the Pink _Antamasia_, Captain _Dumford_, Commander, and
the Pink ......, Captain _Evers_, Commander, and about two Hours after
he was over the Bar of _South-Carolina_, he saw four Sail of Vessels
standing some one Way, some another; but one of them being a Brigantine,
gave Chase, and, in about two Hours time, came up with his Ship with a
black Flag flying, and after having fir'd several Guns, demanded him to
strike, and to come on Board the Brigantine, commanded by one _Charles
Vane_, a Pyrate, who detained him and four of his Men on board the said
Brigantine, and sent several of his Men on board the _Neptune_; and when
they came on board they commanded him to make Sail, and began to rob and
rifle as they thought fit, _&c._ taking only the _Neptune_ and _Emperor_
with them; for by the Information of the Captain of the _Neptune_ and
_Emperor_, the other two were loaded with Pitch and Tar, which was not
for their Turn, so they would not give Chace to them; but in a small
Time after they had held a Consultation together, they concluded to
carry the Ship _Neptune_ and _Emperor_, with their Crew, to _Green
Turtle Key_, on _Abbaco_, so steered their Course accordingly for the
said Place. About four Days after _John King_, Commander of the
_Neptune_ declares, he fell sick of a violent Fever on board the said
_Vane_'s Brigantine, and _Vane_ asked him, if he would go on board his
own Ship? he readily answered, Yes, if he pleased; so hoisted out his
Boat, and sent him on board. And about four Days afterwards the Pyrates
held a Consultation on board their own Vessel. The Captain, and most of
the Officers, were for taking what they wanted out of the Ship _Neptune_
and _Emperor_, and so let them go about their Business; but the rest of
the Company was not willing for it, because, they said, What should they
clean their Vessel by? And what Defence should they have whilst they
were cleaning? So concluded to proceed on to _Green Turtle Key_, which
they did, and arrived there on or about the 12th of _September_ 1718,
and began to make Preparations for careening their Vessels, which held
about three Weeks, and at the latter End of this Time they had taken
from both Ships such Things as they wanted, and then took their Leaves
of the said Ships and Captains, wishing them a good Voyage home, so set
Sail; but in a little Time after made a Sloop coming into the Harbour of
_Green Turtle Key_, perceiving her to come towards them without any
Fear, came to an Anchor again, and sent away the two Mast Boat after
them with about twelve Men in her, expecting it was a Sloop from
_Providence_ with fifty Men, according to Promise, when they left
_Providence_, but in three Hours, or thereabouts, they spoke with her,
which gave them Account that they came from _Providence_; and also
laying down the State and Condition of that Island, it being the
expected Sloop aforesaid, out of which some of the Men entered with
_Vane_, but know not how many. And likewise the said _King_ farther
declares, that he heard some of the Pyrates say, that Sloop had brought
Ammunition and Provisions, _&c._ and the Commander's Name was one
_Nicholas Woodall_. The said _King_ asked what was the best News at
_Providence_? They replied, None good: But bid him ask not many
Questions, but fit up his Ship, in order to go for _England_ or
_Providence_; if the latter, they would take Care to see us to
_Providence_, and did believe they should go in and surrender themselves
up to the King's Pardon. The next Morning, being very much disturb'd
with the News that the Sloop brought from _Providence_ by the said
_Woodall_, they voted to Maroon Captain _Walker_, but that did not take
Place, so put it to Vote again to maroon and destroy the _Neptune_,
which they did with cutting away the Masts, Rigging, Sails, Beams, and
firing a Gun, double loaded with Shot down her Hold, and totally
disabled her from ever proceeding her Voyage home to _England_. And the
said _King_ does verily believe, that the said _Woodall_'s Sloop coming
there, was the Occasion of all the aforesaid Mischief, believing what
was done was to pay him for his great Favour done them. And farther, the
said Captain _King_ says, that some of the Pyrates, who were his
Friends, told him, that if that Sloop had not come, this Damage would
not have been; and that they were very sorry for it; so by the said
_Vane_'s Order they went to work to load this _Woodall_'s Sloop with
Rice, Pitch, Tar, Deer Skins, Sails, Rigging, _&c._ After she was
loaded, being the next Day, they all sailed together as Pyrates, taking
with them one of Captain _Walker_'s Sons, with his Sloop, to tend on
them, and as Pilot; but before they got out of the Channel, arrived to
the Ships _Neptune_ and _Emperor_, a Sloop from _Providence_, sent by
the Governor to hear what was the best News there, hearing that _Vane_
was there. The Captains of the said Sloop, _Hornigold_ and _Cockram_
told the Captains _Powers_ and _King_, that they were come by the
Governor's Order to assist them in what they could, who accordingly did,
with making Dispatch to _Providence_, to acquaint his Excellency the
Governor what sad Condition they were in by the Pyrates hard Usage,
leaving them without Provisions, _&c._ So the said Captains _Hornigold_
and _Cockram_ set Sail that Night, and in three or four Days after took
the Sloop _Woolfe_, _Nicholas Woodall_, Master, that had traded with
_Charles Vane_, the Pyrate, and carried him to his Excellency the
Governor of _Providence_, who seized his Vessel, and confined him
Prisoner. By that Time _Vane_ came in a second time to _Green Turtle
Key_, and began a second Plunder, taking from the Ships Rice, Rigging,
Masts, Sails, _&c._ from both Ships, and told the said _King_, that if
he offered to touch his Prize he would burn her, and him in her, if ever
he catched him again; so sailed away the second time: And about three
Weeks after arrived the said Captains _Hornigold_ and _Cockram_, with
five Sloops from _Providence_, sent down by the Governor, to save what
Goods they could out of the _Neptune_, that was in so much Danger. The
next Day they began to load the Sloops, and got them loaded in two Days,
so sailed away. The said _King_ came to _Providence_ to consult and
agree with the Governor what to do in such a Case. After some Time spent
it was concluded to fit out the _Willing Mind_ with Guns and Men, enough
to stand an Engagement with _Vane_, and sell the _Neptune_; and, in a
few Days after, did accordingly put her up publick to Sale, and it was
thus sold to one Mr. _George Hooper_, for seventy one Pounds current
Money of _Jamaica_, he being the Person that bid the most Money for her.
The _Willing Mind_ being fitted, sailed from _Providence_ the 15th of
_November_ 1718, and arrived at _Green Turtle Key_ the 19th, and took
the Goods out of the _Neptune_, being in a very bad Condition; and after
they had taken out all her Cargo, finding the _Neptune_ to be better
than they did expect; and, having a fair Wind, brought both Ships up to
_Providence_, the _Neptune_ got in safe, but the _Willing Mind_ struck
on the Bar, and sprung a Leak, insomuch that she was forced to unload
and careen, and, when down, found her to be very bad, a Piece of her
main Keel being gone, so was forced to hawl her ashore; and when the
Carpenters had done what could be done to her, she could not be got up
again by all the Strength that could be made, and tried for several
Days, breaking and tearing all to pieces, but all to no Purpose; so the
Governor order'd a Warrant of Survey on her, and was found by the
Surveyors not sufficient to proceed any further, being very much damaged
in her Wood-Work and Iron-Work, _&c._ Whereupon the said _King_ desired
a second Survey of his Ship and Goods, they lying in a very bad
Condition. Now in the Harbour of _Providence_ there being no Vessels to
carry them to _England_, he therefore is now going to _Carolina_ to
consult with Mr. _Richard Splat_, who shipp'd the Goods on board, and to
know of him what further may be done with the said Goods, and that he
may rightly apprize all they concern'd, of the present Condition of the
Ship and Goods; he has further taken the Opinion of Captain _Thomas
Walker_, Captain _Richard Thompson_, and Captain _Edward Holmes_,
Persons who are well acquainted what sad Condition the Ship and Goods
are now in; whereupon the said _King_, and one of the Mariners belonging
to the Ship _Neptune_, did, and doth hereby protest against the said
_Charles Vane_, and the rest of the Mariners, Pyrates and Robbers,
belonging to the Brigantine aforesaid, and for the feloniously and
pyratically taking, boarding, entering and plundering, and for sinking
and disabling within the Harbour of _Green Turtle Key_, the said Ship
_Neptune_, and for all Damages and Losses accruing thereby to the
Owners, Freighters, or any other Persons concern'd therein. In Testimony
whereof we have hereunto set our Hand and Seals this 5th Day of
_February_, _Anno Dom._ 1718-9.

                          _Of Captain_ BOWEN.

Could the Reader conceive the Pains we have been at, to collect Matters
for the composing a genuine History of the Lives of the Pyrates, and the
great Care we have taken to deliver nothing but the Truth, he would
readily forgive, nay, would be apt to commend our placing those
Particulars in the Appendix of the same Book, which we could not
possibly obtain (notwithstanding our diligent Enquiries) before the
Lives were printed, and the Book in a manner ready for Publication.

What we have said in the foregoing Part of this Volume, of Captain
_Bowen_, may be depended on as Truth; but as we had not that Certainty
of his Original we now have, we rather chose to be silent than impose on
our Readers with Fables of our own Invention: We have since learn'd (and
it is with Reason we can depend on our Account, having it from one who
personally knew, and often convers'd with him) that he was born of
creditable Parents, in the Island of _Bermudas_, who took Care to give
him a good Education answerable to the Vocation he was design'd for,
which was the Sea.

The first Voyage he made was to _Carolina_, where some Merchants finding
him every Way capable, and that he was a sober intelligent Man, gave him
the Command of a Ship, and sent him to the _West-Indies_. He continued
in this Employ for several Years, but one Voyage, in his Return, he had
the Misfortune to fall in with, and be taken, by a _French_ Pyrate, who
having no Artist on board, detain'd Captain _Bowen_ to navigate their
Vessel; and after cruizing some Time in the _West-Indies_, shap'd their
Course for the _Guiney_ Coast, where they made several Prizes, and took
several good Artists; but having Experience of Captain _Bowen_, he could
by no Means prevail on them for a Discharge; tho' notwithstanding the
Service he was to them, they treated him as roughly as they did their
other Prisoners, of which I have already taken Notice in Captain
_White_'s Life.

They (the Pyrates) doubled the _Cape_ of _Good Hope_, steer'd for,
refresh'd at _Johanna_, and having made their Voyage to the
_East-Indies_, lost their Ship, as is already shewn in the above Life,
(and need not be here repeated) on _Madagascar_: The other
Particularities which are not set down in _Bowen_'s own Life, will be
found in those of his Companions; as his going with Captain _Read_; the
taking the _Grabb_; the coming to _Mayotta_, and from thence in the
_Grabb_ to _Madagascar_; the joining of that Vessel and _Fourgette_'s;
the taking the _Speaker_; his succeeding _Booth_ in the Command, and his
Death at _Mascarenas_.


                                   OF
                        Capt. _Nathaniel North_,
                             And his CREW.

We have placed this Life in the Appendix, which will not perhaps be
thought a proper Place; but we could not gather the Particulars, which
were collected out of several different Journals, Time enough to insert
it in the Body of the Book, and therefore, thought of reserving this
Life for Part of another Volume; but when we had compiled it, and found
it was a Sort of Recapitulation of the Adventures of the _Madagascar_
Pyrates which went before, we judged it more proper to give it in the
Appendix than to separate this Gentleman from his Companions; and we
were the rather induc'd to this, as the Reader will here find an Account
of _Bowen_'s Death, which we had not learn'd at the Time we wrote his
Life; the Papers which we got after a long Search, and which has
furnish'd us with some other Particulars of that Rover's Life, not being
at that Time to be found.

                   *       *       *       *       *

Captain _North_ was born at _Bermudas_, and was the Son of a Sawyer,
which Business he himself was bred up to, but took, at last, to the
Seas, at the Age of 17 or 18, shipping himself Cook on board a Sloop,
built at _Bermudas_, for some Gentlemen of _Barbadoes_, with Design to
fit her out for a Privateer. She was bound to her Owners, but the Master
took _Santa Vdas_ in the Way, and loaded with Salt. When they came to
_Barbadoes_ all the Crew was press'd, and _North_ with his Companions
were put on board the _Reserve_.

The Master applied himself to the Governor, and got all his Men clear'd,
_North_ excepted, who, as he was a Lad, was neglected, and left on board
the Man of War, which soon after sail'd for _Jamaica_; some Time before
the _Reserve_ was relieved from this Station, he laid Hold of an
Opportunity to run away, and shipp'd himself on board a Sugar Drover, in
which Way of Life he continued about two Years, and being an able
Sailor, tho' no Artist, he was offer'd to go Master of one of these
Coasters, which he refus'd, and went on board a Privateer.

The first Voyage he made, as a Privateer, they took a couple of good
Prizes, which made every Man's Share very considerable; but _North_, as
he had got his Money lightly, so he spent it, making the Companions of
his Dangers the Companions of his Diversions, or rather joining himself
with them, and following their Example; which all (who are acquainted
with the Way of Life of a successful _Jamaica_ Privateer) know is not an
Example of the greatest Sobriety and Oeconomy.

His Money being all spent, he took the same Method for a Recruit, that
is, he went a second Time a Privateering, and met with such Success,
that he engag'd very heartily in this Course of Life, and made several
lucky Cruizes.

Some Time after he grew tir'd, thought of trading, and shipp'd himself
on board a Brigantine, bound for the _Spanish_ Coast, commanded by one
Captain _Reesby_: This Vessel went both on the Trading and Privateer
Account, so that the Men shipp'd for half Wages, and equal Shares of
what Prizes they should make, in the same Manner, as to the Shares, as
on board a Privateer; their trading answer'd very poorly, and their
privateering Business still worse, for they return'd without making any
Prize.

They were forced to leave the _Spanish_ Coast, on Account of a _Spanish
Guarda la Costa_, of 40 Guns and Three hundred and fifty _Frenchmen_,
commanded by a Captain of the same Nation. When they made the Island of
_Jamaica_, they fell in with _Bluefields_, off which Place two _French_
Privateer Sloops were cruizing, one of which was formerly a Privateer of
_Jamaica_, called the _Paradox_; they immediately clapp'd Capt. _Reesby_
on board, taking him for a Trader, come from the _Spanish_ Coast, and
weakly mann'd; however, they were soon made sensible of the Mistake, for
they came to fetch Wool, and one of them went away shorn; I mean
_Reesby_ took one of them, and the other was obliged to a good Pair of
Heels for his Safety. _Reesby_ lost ten Men, killed outright in the
Engagement, and had seven wounded; the latter, tho' he had made but a
broken Voyage, he put ashore at _Bluefields_, and ordered great Care to
be taken of them, at the Owners Expence: Here he took in fresh
Provision, and then beat up to _Port Royal_, where _Reesby_ paid them
very honourably, gave them a handsome Entertainment, and begg'd they
would not leave him, as he had a very great Value for them all; but for
_North_ particularly, who was a good Swimmer, manag'd a Canoe, with
great Dexterity, and fear'd nothing.

Upon this Desire of the Captain's, _North_ and the greater Part staid
ashore till Captain _Reesby_ was refitted, and went a second Voyage with
him to the Coast, at seventeen Dollars a Month, and no Share; they
carried 300 Negroes, beside Bale Goods; they staid four Months on the
Coast, and dispos'd of all the Slaves and Goods to great Advantage. Upon
their Return to _Jamaica_, after some Stay on the Island, Captain
_Reesby_ not going out again, _North_ went once more a Privateering, and
made a considerable Booty. While _North_ was ashore after a Cruize, he
was press'd on board the _Mary_ Man of War: He made a Cruize in her to
the _Spanish_ Coast, and return'd to _Jamaica_; but hearing the _Mary_
was soon to go to _England_, he, and three more, resolv'd to swim ashore
from the Keys, where the Men of War lie, but he was taken as he was
going off the Head, and whipp'd; he, however, found Means to make his
Escape, before the Ship left the Island, and went on board the _Neptune_
Sloop, a Privateer, commanded by Captain _Lycence_, then Lieutenant of
the _Reserve_, who, while the Ship was in the Carpenter's Hands, got a
Commission of the Governor to take a Cruize. Captain _Moses_, who
commanded the _Reserve_, went on board their Sloop, under the Command of
his Lieutenant, for Diversion only: They cruized off _Hispaniola_, where
they met with a _French_ Letter of Mart Merchant Man, of 18 Guns, and
118 Men, who had the Day before engaged the _Swan_ Man of War, and shook
her off.

The _Neptune_ attack'd her, and Captain _Moses_ was wounded one of the
first, and carried down; _Lycense_ order'd to board, but the
Quarter-Master, who steer'd, mistook the Helm, the Sloop fell off, and
the _French_ pouring in a Volley of small Shot, Captain _Lycence_ was
kill'd, which being told to _Moses_, as the Surgeon dress'd him, he
order'd _North_ to the Helm, bid them not be discouraged, and he would
be upon Deck immediately. Accordingly he came up as soon as dress'd,
laid the Ship on board, where they made a very obstinate Resistance; but
the _French_ Captain being kill'd, who received eleven Shot before he
dropp'd, they, at length, became Masters.

The Privateer lost ten Men, and twenty were wounded: The _French_ had
fifty Men killed and wounded, among whom was the Captain, who had
received two Shot, as he was going down to the Surgeon to get his Blood
staunch'd, and came upon Deck just as he was boarded, where, encouraging
his Men, he was distinguished and aimed at.

When they had brought the Prize into _Jamaica_, as she was an _English_
Bottom, built at _Bristol_, and called the _Crown_, the former Owners
sued to have half the Ship and Cargo, and recovered one third.

_North_ went again a Privateering, Captain _Moses_ his Ship being not
fitted, he would take a second Cruize, and _North_ with him. Some Time
after their Return, Captain _Moses_ being a cruizing in the _Reserve_,
_North_, who was ashore, was press'd on board the _Assistance_ Man of
War; and on the _Reserve_'s coming, being recommended by Captain _Moses_
to his own Captain, he was handsomely treated, and made one of the
Barge's Crew: He was very easy till the _Assistance_ was order'd to
_England_, and then, as he was apprehensive of going into a cold
Climate, he took his Leave of the Man of War, and said nothing. He then
went on board a Privateer again, and made several Prizes, two of which
were _English_ Bottoms, and sued for by former Owners; _North_ thinking
it hard to venture his Life, and have Part of his Prize Money taken
away, and the Press being hot in _Jamaica_, he resolved to sail no more
with the _English_; but went to _Curasoe_ into the _Dutch_ Service, and
sail'd with a _Spanish_ Trader to the Coast of _New Spain_ several
Voyages. In the last he made, they were chased ashore by a couple of
_French_ Sloops, one of which was commanded by a _Dutchman_, named
_Lawrence_, who, with his Comrade, took Possession of their Vessel, and
rifled her; the Crew of the Prize called to them, and asked, if they
would give them good Quarters? which they promis'd; took them all on
board, and used 'em very handsomely.

The _French_ gave the Prisoners a small Sloop they took a while after,
and they returned to _Curaso_.

He having now forgot his Resentment, he return'd to _Jamaica_, and went
on board and cruiz'd in a _Spanish Barca Longa_, of 10 Guns, commanded
by Captain _Lovering_, born at _Jamaica_; they cruiz'd three Months in
the _West Indies_, and making but a small Hand of it, they put for
_Newfoundland_, to try their Fortune on the Banks: Here they met a Man
of War, who renew'd their Commission for six Months longer. The first
Prize they made was a _French_ Ketch, with a _Spanish_ Pass, and would
have pass'd for a _Spaniard_, but by strict Search, and threatning of
the Men, they discovered her to be what she really was, tho' she had, as
a _Spaniard_, slipp'd thro' the Fingers of a Man of War before.

They carried their Prize into Harbour, went again upon the Cruize, met
with a _French_ Letter of Mart Merchant Man, a _Bristol_ built Ship,
called the _Pelican_, of 18 Guns, and Seventy five Men, half laden with
Fish: This Ship stood them a long Argument; they clapp'd her on board,
and two of their Men enter'd, but missing lashing, the _Barca Longa_
fell a-stern, and the two Men were made Prisoners; however, they came up
with her again, clapp'd her on board a second Time, and carried her into
the same Port where they had left the Ketch.

They after this put to Sea again, and being discovered by the _French_
Settlement ashore, they went into St. _Mary_'s Bay, where they fell in
with a large _French_ Fly-Boat, of 800 Tons, eighty Men, and 18 Guns,
and laden with Fish: They chased and came up with her, under _French_
Colours; when they were pretty near the _Frenchman_ they haled, and
ask'd, whence they came? a _Guernsey_ Man, at the Bowsprit End,
answer'd, from _Petit Guavers_; that they had been cruizing on the
Banks, and were going into the Bay for Refreshment. The _Frenchman_ bid
them come no nearer, but send their Boat on board; they keeping on the
Chase he fired at them, they did not mind this, but run up a long Side
and boarded him; the _French_ ran to their close Quarters, and disputed
the Ship three Quarters of an Hour, when they all call'd for Quarters
except one Man, who wou'd take none, but ran like a Madman into the
Thick of the _English_, and wounded several, tho' he was soon dispatch'd
by their Pistols.

They carried this Prize to join the others, and turning all the
Prisoners ashore, except what were necessary to condemn their Prizes;
they stood, with a Fleet of four Sail, for _Rhode Island_.

Here they condemn'd the Fly-Boat and Ketch, but found a great Difficulty
in getting the _Pelican_ condemn'd, the _English_ Owners putting in
their Claim; but, at length, a _Scotch_ Lawyer did their Business, upon
leaving 300 l. in his Hands to bear the Charge of any future Suit.
Captain _Lovering_ dying here, the Ship's Company bought the _Pelican_,
broke up the _Barca Longa_, sent her Owners their Shares, and got a
Commission for the Master to cruize Southward as far as the Line, and to
be valid for eighteen Months certain, two Years allowing for Accidents.

They fitted this Ship for a long Voyage, out of the Joint Stock of the
Company; but Iron Hoops being scarce in _New England_, they were obliged
to take Casks hoop'd with Wood, which I mention, because it proved the
Ruin of their Voyage to the _East Indies_ for a whole Year.

They being fitted for the Sea, they set Sail and steer'd for the _Cape_
of _Good Hope_, which they doubled in the Month of _June_, made the best
of their Way to _Madagascar_, and went into _Augustine_ Bay, where they
victualled and watered, but before this was done it was _August_, which
was too late to go to the _East-Indies_; which they propos'd to do with
Design, to cruize on the _Moors_, not intending to Pyrate among the
_Europeans_, but honestly and quietly to rob what _Moors_ fell in their
Way, and return home with clean Consciences, and clean, but full Hands,
within the limited Time of their Commission.

From _Augustine_ they went to _Johanna_, and the Provisions they had
salted up at _Madagascar_ not being well done, it began to spoil; this
and their Cloaths wanting Repair, made them desperately resolve to take
the King of _Johanna_ and make him ransome himself, but the Master wou'd
not take Charge of the Ship, being unacquainted with the Coast: They
cruiz'd among the Islands, landed at _Comaro_, and took the Town, but
found no Booty, excepting some Silver Chains, and check'd Linnen. From
hence they went to _Mayotta_, where they took in a _Frenchman_ who had
been morooned there, and maintain'd by the King; they consulted with him
about the surprizing and taking his Town. The _Frenchman_ was averse to
it, as he owed him the Obligation of being preserved; however, he was in
their Hands, and must do as they would have him: They surrounded the
King's House after they had been three Days in his Town, and took him
and all the Inhabitants; but the King's Son made his Way thro' the
thickest of them with his Cutlash, tho' he was shot afterward. The
Pretence they made use of for this inhospitable Manner, was, that the
King had poison'd the Crew of a Ship, which was their Consort; he denied
it, as well he might, for they themselves never heard of a Ship of the
Name they gave this fictitious one. The King they carried on board, the
other Prisoners they put into a Sort of a Temple, with a Guard over them
of 36 Men.

The Alarm being given in the Country, the Natives came down in a Body of
some Thousands, and attack'd the Guard; but the Ship hearing the Fire,
and seeing the Hills covered with Blacks, discharged several great Guns,
loaded with Patridge, which making a very great Slaughter, obliged them
to retire.

The King ransom'd himself for some Silver Chains to the Value of a
thousand Dollars, and for what Provision they demanded; and at the
setting him ashore, swore Allegiance to them as Masters of the Country,
and took an Oath besides, never to poison any more white Men.

After this notable Expedition, they staid here a Fortnight, tho' always
on their Guard, and then went back for _Augustine_ with about 20 Slaves,
they carried away with them for Servants.

Here a Sickness coming among them, they built Huts ashore; they lost,
notwithstanding all their Care and Precaution, their Captain and thirty
Men, by the Distemper which they contracted; but it abating, they
thought of going to Sea again, but on examining their Water Casks, they
found the Hoops all worm eaten and rotten, so that there was no
Proceeding, but this Defect was repaired by their Cooper, who was an
ingenious Fellow; he went into the Woods with the _Mayotta_ Slaves, and
with Withies and other Stuff he gathered, fitted them up, and made them
tight, in acknowledging of which Service, they chose him Captain, and
_North_ was made Quarter-Master.

At _Augustine_ they pick'd up some Straglers, among whom was _David
Williams_, and on a Muster, they found they had a hundred and five Men.
They then made their Vessel a free Ship, that is, they agreed every Man
should have an equal Share in all Prizes; and proceeded for the Mouth of
the _Red Seas_.

In the Night, after they had reach'd their Station, they made two Ships,
one was the _Mocha_ Frigate, of 40 Guns, commanded by _Culliford_: she
had been an _East India_ Man, and under the Command of one Captain
_Stout_; the other Ship was called the _Soldada_, a Ship of 16 Guns, the
Captain's Name _Shivers_; they haled one another, and on both Sides gave
the same Answers, _from the Seas_, and upon Agreement, they all lay by
that Night: In the Morning they consorted, and agreed to make an equal
Division of all Prizes, which any of the three should take from that
Time for two Months to come.

The _Pelican_ spared Wood, Water, and some of her Hands to Captain
_Culliford_, and here _Williams_ shifted on board him. About ten Days
after, these three had join'd Company a large _Moor_'s Ship, on which
they afterwards mounted 70 Guns, hove in Sight.

They all gave Chase, but the small Ship came first up with the _Moor_,
who exchang'd several Shot with the _Soldada_ and _Pelican_; but the
_Soldada_ clapp'd her on board, and before the _Pelican_ could enter a
Man, the _Moors_ call'd for Quarters: In boarding the _Moor_, she fired
a Broadside upon the _Soldada_, but only two Shot hull'd her, and kill'd
two Men, which was the only Loss they had in taking a thousand
Prisoners, Passengers, and Sailors.

All the Money was carried on board the _Mocha_ Frigate, and divided
between her Crew and the _Soldada_, excluding without other Reason than
_sic volumus_, the _Pelican_ from any Share.

The Crew of the _Pelican_ expostulated with them, and bid them remember
they had spared both Wood and Water, or the _Mocha_ could not have kept
the Station; instead of any Answer, they receiv'd a Command to be gone,
or they would sink them; they answering, they could not go by
themselves, wanting the Water and Wood they had spared. The two Consorts
gave them a thousand Dollars, and some Water out of the _Moor_, bidding
them buy Wood, where they could purchase it, and so left the _Pelican_
to her self, going away for the Coast of _Malabar_, where they put the
Prisoners and Horses they had taken ashore, sunk the _Soldada_, and
thence went to the Isle of _St. Mary_'s on _Madagascar_, where the
_Moor_'s Ship now lies sunk. They shared out of this Prize a thousand
Pounds a Man in Silver and Gold besides other Goods; and the two Pyrates
amounted to the Number of 350 Men.

The _Pelican_ kept the same Station for some Days, when a large _Moor_
Ship hove in Sight, they gave Chase, and the _Moor_, not suspecting her
for an Enemy, did not endeavour to get away; when the _Pelican_ came up,
she fired for the _Moor_ to bring to, which made him set his small
Sails, tho' with the Loss of several Men; for the _Pelican_ being close
up, brought them down with the small Arms. When the _Moor_ had, at
length, hove out his small Sails, the _Pelican_ could not gain upon him
enough to board, tho' she was not a Pistol Shot a-stern; whenever she
came upon his Lee Quarter, the _Moor_ being a tall Ship, took away the
Wind from the _Pelican_, and she could never get to Windward of him. She
ply'd her fore Chase all this while, and drove the _Moors_ from their
stern Chase, but could not, as they endeavour'd to do, strike the
_Moors_ Rudder, or any other Way disable him. At length, by the Fear and
bad Steerage of the _Moor_, the _Pelican_ ran up along Side of them, but
as she miss'd lashing, she was obliged to shoot a head; in the mean
while the _Moor_ Wore round, the _Pelican_ put to Stays after him but
not Staying, and they being all in Confusion, they Wore also; but in
this Time the _Moor_ had got the Start, and setting all the Canvas he
could pack on his Ship's Back, wrong'd the _Pelican_, and got off.

The Loss of this Ship made the Crew almost distracted, and made, for
some Time, a great Division among them, some cursing the Ship for a
heavy Sailor, and proposing to return home, others cursing themselves,
and the ill Management by which they miss'd lashing, and propos'd going
to _Madagascar_, and the breaking her up, since as she was a single
Bottom, she must be worm-eaten; but Time, which mollifies the greatest
Rage, abated these Contentions, and put an End to the Animosities which
sprung from their Disappointment.

They being cool, resolved for the _Malabar_ Coast, on which they took
three _Moor_ Ships in a little Time; the first they discharged, after
taking out 6000 Dollars; the second they took for their own Use, mounted
her with 26 Guns, and called her the _Dolphin_; the third they sold on
the same Coast for 18000 Dollars. Their own Ship they set adrift. From
this Coast they made for _Madagascar_, and near the Island _Mascarenas_
lost all their Masts in a Hurricane. They put up Jury-Masts, came to St.
_Mary_'s and new masted. Here they found Captain _Culliford_, Captain
_Shivers_, and their Prize, with three Merchant Men from _America_,
which were come to trade with them, one of which was the _Pembrook_,
commanded by _Samuel Burges_, belonging to _Frederick Phillips_,
Merchant at _New-York_. The Captain of the _Dolphin_, and some of the
Men being weary of this Life, went home in these Merchant Ships, and the
Crew chose one _Samuel Inless_, who lived on the Island, for their
Captain; they fitted out for the _Streights_ of _Malacca_, where they
made several Prizes of _Moor_ Ships, but of little value to them.

_North_ on board one of the Prizes, was separated from the rest by bad
Weather, and drove to great Straights for Water. The _Moor_ Merchant,
who was on board with him, and whom he had treated very humanely, shewed
him a Draught, by which he came to a small Island not far from the
_Dutch_ Settlement, and watered. The _Moor_ told him, that he ran the
Risque of his Life should it be known that he had given him a Sight of
this Draught. In return for this Service, when he met with his
Companions, he got the _Moor_'s Ship discharged.

They, after this, made for _Nicobar_, near _Achen_, and, in the Way, met
a large _Dane_ Ship, which they plunder'd, and hove down by, clean'd,
and return'd to _Madagascar_, where they shar'd their Booty, which was,
besides Goods, between 3 and 400 l. a Man. A Month after their Arrival
three _English_ Men of War appear'd in Sight, the _Anglesea_, Captain
_Littleton_, the _Hastings_, Captain _White_, and the _Lizard_, Captain
_Rumsey_. These Ships occasioned their hawling up the _Dolphin_, which,
as they could not get her as high as they design'd, they set Fire to.

Commadore _Littleton_ brought a Pardon for such of the Pyrates as would
accept it, and many of them, among whom were _Culliford_ and _Shivers_
did, and went home with Merchant Men. _North_ accepted it also, but
would not trust to it, finding the Time fixed for their Surrender was
elapsed before the Men of War arrived.

Most of the Pyrates having left the Isle of St. _Mary_'s, where the
King's Ships lay, _North_ thought it not safe for him to stay, and
therefore putting all he had into the _Dolphin_'s Boat, he design'd to
join his Comrades on the Main of _Madagascar_; but being overset by a
Squawl, all the People were lost except himself, who swam four Leagues,
and a Negroe Woman, whom he put on the Bottom of the Boat.

Being now on the Main, and quite naked, he frighted the Negroes he met
with, as he got out of the Water, for they took him for a Sea-Devil; but
one Woman, who had been used to sell Fowls at the white Mens Houses, had
the Courage not to run away, and, when he came near, knew him; she gave
him half her Petticoat to cover his Nakedness, and calling a Negroe Man
who carried her Things, and was run into the Woods; they help'd him to
perform his Journey to the Dwelling of some white Men, which was sixteen
Miles from the Place where he come on Shore; a great Journey for a Man
so feeble with swimming. He was kindly received and cloathed by his
Comrades, whom he staid with, till he had recovered his Strength, and
then he went to a black Prince of his Acquaintance, with whom he staid
till the Arrival of Captain _Fourgette_, which was a full Year.

In this Vessel (which I have already said in _White_'s Life was taken)
he went round the North-End to the West-Side, and came into _Methelage_,
where they surprized the _Speaker_; the Manner of which Surprize is also
mentioned in the same Life; and, after the Death of Captain _Booth_, was
chosen Captain's Quarter-Master, by _Bowen_, who succeeded in the
Voyage, and the Consequences of it are already set down, for he was in
the _Speaker_ till she was lost.

The next Voyage he made was in the _Speedy Return_ (taken from Captain
_Drummond_,) in the Capacity of Company's Quarter-Master, with Design to
cruise in the _Red Seas_; but touching at the Island of _Mayotta_, they
consorted with Captain _Howard_, whom they met with at the Island, as is
already said. From thence they went and victualled at _Augustine_,
having promised Captain _Bowen_ to meet him in two Months; accordingly
returning thither, and missing him, they went to _Mayotta_ to enquire
after him; but hearing there that he was gone a Voyage, and as the Place
of Rendezvous was off the Highlands of St. _John_'s, they steered their
Course thither, to join him, and lie for the _Moor_'s Fleet from
_Mocoa_.

In their Passage they met with a violent Storm, in which they were near
foundering, it beat in their Stern, and obliged them to throw over all
their Guns (two excepted, which lay in the Hold) and forced them into
the Gulf of _Persia_, where they took several small Vessels, which they
ripp'd up to mend their Ship.

Being very much in want of Water, having staved all their Casks, to save
themselves in the Storm, and meeting with little in the Vessels taken,
they hoisted out the Canoe to chase a Fishing Vessel, that they might be
inform'd where they should find Water. This Boat made from them with all
their Force, but the Ship firing, the People all leap'd into the Water,
some of whom were drowned, and the rest got ashoar, except one Man, whom
they came up with; but as soon as they thought to lay hold on him, he
dived, and kept them in play near an Hour and a half: They would not
shoot him, because it did not answer their Ends; but, at length,
_North_, who was in the Boat, took the Sprit, and struck at him as he
rose, hoping to disable him, but he broke his Jaw. They took him by this
Means, brought him on board, sent him to the Surgeon, and when they
despair'd of his being able to speak, he asked for a Pipe of Tobacco,
which he smoak'd, and drunk a Dram; after which he seem'd very hearty.
As the Pyrates had on board several black Slaves, who spoke the
_East-India_ Tongue, one of them was ordered to enquire of him where
they might find Water, promising him his Liberty if he would direct
them. On this Promise he carried them to a convenient landing Place,
where he shewed a Well full of Dirt, out of which, after a great deal of
Trouble to come at it, they drew but three Buckets of Water, which
sufficed those only who went on Shoar, to the Number of 30. Enraged with
this Disappointment after so much Labour, they threaten'd their Prisoner
with Death, who told them, if they would have Patience till the Sun was
set, they would have Plenty, for the Spring would rise, and flow all
Night; which they found to be Fact, and filled twenty Tun of Water, and
return'd on board, carrying the Man with them, for whom they made a
gathering of some Goods, and about thirty Dollars; these they gave him,
and exacted a Promise, that whenever he saw any Ship on that Coast,
which made the same Signals they had made, he would go on board and
render them what Service he could, assuring him he would always meet
with civil Treatment, and be well rewarded.

After this they cruised on the Gulf of _Persia_ some Days, in hopes of
meeting their Consort, not doubting but she had some Share in the Storm.

The Time of their Consortship being now over, and she not appearing,
they steered for the Highlands of St. _John_ near _Surat_, the Place of
Rendezvous. When they made the Land they spied a tall Ship, and
immediately making all clear for an Engagement, they gave chase. The
other Ship doing the like, they soon met, and, to the great Joy of both
Parties, she proved their Consort. Upon Enquiry they found the
_Prosperous_ had been ten Days on this Station, and had not met with the
Storm which had so roughly handled the _Speedy Return_, on giving an
Account of their Misfortune, _viz._ their being obliged to throw over
their Guns, and a Quantity of Provisions, Captain _Howard_ spared them
some fresh Provisions, and expressing great Concern for the Accident,
renewed his Consortship for two Months longer; that is, they agreed
whatever Prizes were taken should be equally divided between the Crews
of both Ships. After they had cruised here fourteen Days, they spied
seven Sail of tall Ships, which proved to be the _Moors_ from _Mocoa_;
they both gave Chace, but the _Speedy Return_ being the better Sailor
first came up with one of them, laid her on board, and carried her in a
very little Time, with little more Damage than the Loss of her Bowsprit.
The _Prosperous_ kept on the Chace, and having Captain _Whaley_ on board
as a Pilot, took another at an Anchor, as is said (so need not be
repeated) in Captain _Howard_'s Life.

The _Speedy Return_ steered with her Prize for the Coast of _Malabar_,
where, by Agreement, she was to wait ten Days for her Consort. In six
Days the _Prosperous_ joined them, but without any Prize, having rifled
her, as is before said in another Life.

Here they made an equal Dividend of their Prizes, burnt the _Speedy
Return_, sunk the _Prosperous_, went all on board the _Moor_'s Ship, put
to Sea, and cruised on this Coast, where they made several Prizes. When
they came over against _Cachine_, some black Merchants, Goldsmiths, and
several _Dutch_ Men, came on board to trade with them, bringing a great
many Sequins, and other Gold Coin, to change for _Spanish_ Dollars; as
many of the Pyrates designed to knock off and return home, they gave 500
Dollars for 200 Sequins, for the Conveniency of close Stowage about
them. The Goldsmiths set up their Forges on board the Ship, and were
fully employed in making them Buttons, Buckles, and what else they
fancied, so that they had a fair Opportunity of putting what Alloy they
thought proper. They here also furnished themselves with a good Quantity
of Arrack, Provisions, and Stores, and then leaving the Coast, shaped
their Course for _Madagascar_, but, in the Way, fell in with the Island
of _Mauritius_, and put into a Port called the _North-West Harbour_.
Here they wooded and watered. This Port affords great abundance of a
poisonous Fish called the _Red-Snapper_, the Nature of which was well
known to Captain _Bowen_, who perswaded his Men not to eat of them, but
they were in Port, and then are all Commanders, so that this wholesome
Advice was thrown away upon them. The Captain seeing their Obstinacy,
and that they could not be disswaded, eat with them, chusing rather to
share the same Fate than be left alone to the Mercy of the _Dutch_, as
he was conscious of what he merited.

They supp'd plentifully on the Fish, and drank very heartily after it.
Soon after they began to swell in a frightful Manner. The next Morning
some Planters came on board with Fowls, Goats, _&c._ and seeing the
Pyrates in a miserable Condition, and some of these Fish lying on the
Decks, asked if they had not eat of them? Being answer'd they had,
advised their drinking plentifully of strong Liquors, which was the only
way to expel the Poyson, which had dispatch'd them all in less Time, had
they not done it after their unfortunate Meal. They readily followed
this Advice, as the Prescription was agreeable, and by this Means, with
the Care of the Surgeons, of whom they had several expert in their
Business, and stock'd with good Medicines, they all recovered, four
excepted, who paid their Obstinacy with their Lives.

They here heel'd their Ship, scrubb'd, tallow'd, and took in what they
wanted. When they had staid three Months in this Port, the Governor sent
and desired them to put to Sea, for he expected the Arrival of the
_Dutch East-India_ Men; they accordingly got every Thing ready, and went
out, but left several of their Men behind them, as we have said in
_Bowen_'s Life.

From hence they steered for _Madagascar_, and in their Passage stopped
at _Don Mascarenas_, where they took in a Quantity of Hogs, Goat, Sheep,
Fowls of all Sorts, and Green Turtle. Captain _Bowen_ here went ashoar
with 40 of his Men, having obtained the Governor's Protection by the
Force of Presents. These Men design'd to give over their Pyracy, and
return home the first Opportunities offer'd them. In six Months after
they had staid here, Captain _Bowen_ was taken ill of the dry Belly Ach,
a Distemper as rife here as in the _West-India_ Islands, and was buried
in the Highway, for the Priests would not allow him holy Ground, as he
was a Heretick.

But to return; when _Bowen_ went ashoar _North_ was chosen Captain. The
Ceremony of this Installation is, the Crew having made choice of him to
Command, either by an unanimous Consent, or by a Majority of Suffrages,
they carry him a Sword in a very solemn Manner, make him some
Complements, and desire he will take upon him the Command, as he is the
most capable among them. That he will take Possession of the great
Cabin; and, on his accepting the Office, he is led into the Cabin in
State, and placed at a Table, where only one Chair is set at the upper
End, and one at the lower End of the Table for the Company's
Quarter-Master. The Captain and he being placed, the latter succinctly
tells him, that the Company having Experience of his Conduct and
Courage, do him the Honour to elect him for their Head, not doubting his
behaving himself with his usual Bravery, and doing every Thing which may
conduce to the publick Good; in Confidence of which, he, in the Name of
the Company, promised to obey all his lawful Commands, and declared him
Captain. Then the Quarter-Master takes up the Sword, which he had before
presented him, and he had returned, puts it into his Hand, and says,
_This is the Commission under which you are to act, may you prove
fortunate to your self and us_. The Guns are then fired round, Shot and
all; he is saluted with three Chears; the Ceremony is ended with an
Invitation from the Captain to such as he thinks fit to have dine with
him, and a large Bowl of Punch is ordered to every Mess.

Captain _North_ leaving this Island steered for _Madagascar_, and came
to Cape _Dolphin_ at the South End, as is said in _White_'s Life, where
he came to an Anchor, and took on board some Refreshments, but it
blowing hard, he was obliged to put to Sea, and leave his Boat with 30
Men behind him. He ran along the East-Side of the Island, and came to a
Place called _Ambonavoula_, in the Latitude of 17, 38. where they put on
Shore some of their Goods, and settled themselves among the Negroes,
several living in a House; here they lived as Sovereign Princes among
the Inhabitants.

The _Moor_ Prisoners they kept on board, and allowed them sufficient
fresh Provisions. _North_ privately bid the Boatswain of the _Moors_
take the Advantage of the Land Breeze in the Night Time, and go off with
the Ship, and what Goods were left on board; or the Pyrates would soon
hawl up the Ship, take every Thing on Shore, and they (marooned there)
would never see their own Country again.

Accordingly the Boatswain following this Advice, laid hold of the
Opportunity of a dark Night, and communicating his Design to the other
_Moors_, whom he did not acquaint with this Advice, as _North_ charg'd
him not, till he was on the Point of executing his Design, they weigh'd
with great Silence and stood to Sea.

The next Morning some of the Pyrates propos'd to go on Board and fetch
off some Iron and other Things to trade with in the Country; but they
were strangely surpriz'd when they miss'd the Ship; they alarm'd the
rest of their Comrades, and went in a Body to Captain _North_ to tell
him what had happen'd. He answer'd, if the _Moors_ were gone off with
the Ship, it was their own Fault; they ought to have left a sufficient
Number of Hands on Board to have secur'd her; that there was now no
Remedy but Patience, for they had no Vessel to pursue with, except they
thought the Canoe proper.

Some of the Pyrates thought as she lay in foul Ground the Cable might be
cut by some Rock, and the Ship blown off to Sea by that Accident; on
starting this, some of them ran up to an Eminence, and from thence spy'd
the Ship as far as they could well see, with all Sails set, which was a
cruel and convincing Proof that their Loss was irreparable.

They endeavoured to make themselves easy, since there was no Help; and
transporting their Goods to different Abodes, at small Distances, they
settled themselves, buying Cattle and Slaves, and lived in a neighbourly
Manner one among another five Years; clear'd a great deal of Ground, and
planted Provisions as Yamms, Potatoes, _&c._ The Natives among whom they
fix'd, had frequent Broils and Wars among themselves, but the Pyrates
interposed, and endeavoured to reconcile all differences; _North_
deciding their Disputes not seldom, with that Impartiality and strict
Regard to distributive Justice (for he was allowed, by all, a Man of
admirable good natural Parts) that he ever sent away, even the Party who
was cast, satisfied with the Reason, and content with the Equity of his
Decisions.

These Inclinations which the Pyrates shewed to Peace, and the Example
they set of an amicable Way of Life; for they carefully avoided all
Jars, and agreed to refer all Cause of Complaint among themselves which
might arise, to a cool Hearing before _North_, and twelve of their
Companions, gave them a great Character among the Natives, who were
before very much prejudiced against the White Men. Nay, in this Point of
keeping up a Harmony among themselves, they were so exact, that whosever
spoke but in an angry or peevish Tone, was rebuked by all the Company,
especially if before any of the Country, tho' even but a Slave, of their
own; for they thought, and very justly, that Unity and Concord were the
only Means to warrant their Safety; for the People being ready to make
War on one another upon the slightest Occasion, they did not doubt but
they would take the Advantage of any Division which they might observe
among the Whites, and cut them off whenever a fair Opportunity offered.

_North_ often set this before them, and as often made them remark the
Effects of their Unanimity, which were, the being treated with great
Respect and Deference, and having a Homage paid them as to sovereign
Princes. Nature, we see, teaches the most Illiterate the necessary
Prudence for their Preservation, and Fear works Changes which Religion
has lost the Power of doing, since it has been looked upon as a Trade,
and debased by the scandalous Lives of those who think it their Business
to teach it only, and, satisfied with the Theory, leave the practical
Part to the Laity: For these Men whom we term, and not without Reason,
the Scandal of humane Nature, who were abandoned to all Vice, and lived
by Rapine; when they judged it for their Interest, not only (politickly)
were strictly just, both among themselves, and in composing the
Differences of the neighbouring Natives, but grew continent and sober,
as no doubt they esteemed their Security to depend on shewing the Blacks
they could govern those Passions to which they themselves were Slaves.
Its true, they were all Polygamists, but that was no Scandal among a
People who thought the cohabiting with a pregnant Woman a Sin against
Nature in acting contrary to her Design, which is by Generation to
propagate the animal Race; and who should be guilty of this Crime among
them, they esteemed worse than Beasts, which following Nature, obey her
Orders exactly, and set Men a Lesson of Prudence. When then, I say, they
were continent, I mean they never invaded the Rights either of their
Companions, or of the Natives.

The Reader may, perhaps, be well enough pleased to hear how on the
smallest Difference they proceeded to a Reconciliation; for, as I have
said, it was a Maxim with them, that the least Discord among a few
Particulars would be the Ruin of a whole Body; as from a small neglected
Spark, a general Conflagration may arise and lay the noblest City waste.

On any Mistake from which a Dispute arose, or on any ill-manner'd
Expression let fall in Company, they all broke up, and one of the
Company poured what Liquor was before them on the Ground, saying, no
Contention could creep in among them without Loss; and therefore he
sacrificed that Liquor to the evil Fiend, to prevent a greater Damage.
Then both the contending Parties, on Pain of being banished the Society,
and sent to another Part of the Island, were summon'd to appear at
Captain _North_'s, the next Morning, and, in the mean while, they were
commanded to keep their respective Houses.

The next Morning both the Parties being met, and all the Whites summon'd
to attend, the Captain set the Plaintiff and Defendant on one Side, and
told them, that till the Aggressor had consented to do Justice, and till
the Person injured had forgot his Resentment, they must esteem them both
Enemies to the Publick, and not look upon them as their Friends and
Companions. He then wrote down the Names of all the Assembly, roll'd
them up, and put them into a Hat, out of which, each Party shaking the
Hat, chose six Tickets; and these twelve Rowls or Tickets contained the
Names of the assistant Judges, who, with the Captain, heard and
determined in the Cause, calling and examining the Witnesses. When the
Matter was fully debated, the Court was adjourned to the next Day, and
the Litigators commanded to appear again, and, in the Interim, not to
stir out their Houses, to which they were respectively conducted by two
or three each, lest the Slaves, or the neighbouring Blacks, should, by a
greater Number, have any Suspicion of their Disagreement.

The second Day the Examination began afresh, and the Witnesses were
sifted, as if they had not before been examined, and this to try if they
were consistent with their former Evidence, which was noted down. Then
the Court was again adjourned, and the disagreeing Parties remanded home
till next Morning, when Judgment was given, which was a Fine in
Proportion to the Affront.

The Reason of confining those who had Dissension was to deter them, by
this small Punishment, from all future Quarrels, and to prevent any ill
Accident which might happen by their being at full Liberty.

The Example they set, and the Care they took to accommodate Differences
among their Neighbours, had calmed all the Country round them. After
they had staid here near three Years, Captain _North_, and some of his
Companions, had a Mind to visit the Country Southward, and trade for
more Slaves and Cattle; to which End taking a considerable Quantity of
Powder and Arms, beside what they might use, with 50 Whites and 300
Natives, he set forward on his Journey. When they had travelled about
fourscore Miles Southward, they came to a Nation rich in Slaves and
Cattle, who inhabited the Banks of the largest River on the East-Side
the Island, called _Mangora_. With these People he trafficked for a
great Number of Slaves and Cattle, which he purchased for Guns and
Powder: They being at War when Captain _North_ came among them, with a
neighbouring Prince, he was intreated to give his Assistance, for which
they, the _Mangorians_, promised him a hundred Slaves with 500 Head of
Cattle, and all the Prisoners they should take. On these Conditions he
joined them, and marched to a very large Town of the Enemy's, which was
naturally very strong, and esteemed by the Natives impregnable, being
situated on a high and craggy Rock, which could be ascended by the Way
only leading to the Gate, where was kept a strong Guard. The Blacks in
_North_'s Army were for leaving this Town unattempted, and marching
farther into the Country, in search of Booty; but _North_ told 'em it
was not safe to leave a Garrison of Enemies at their Backs, which would
continually infest them, by falling on their Rear, and which would be an
Obstacle to their carrying off what Plunder they might get together;
beside, it would be an Azyle for all the Country, which would fly
thither till they had gather'd a Body considerable enough to come down
and face them in the Field, which the Enemy might do with reasonable
Hopes of Success, as their Men would be all fresh, while those of his
Party would be fatigued with Marches, may be encumbered by Plunder, and
worn down with the Inconveniencies of lying exposed in the Fields.

The chief of his Allies allowed his Reasons good, were an Attempt on the
Town practicable, which Experience told him was not; for, tho' several
times besieged, it never could be taken, it would be the Loss of a great
deal of Time, and many Mens Lives to offer at it.

_North_ desired he would leave the Management of this Siege to him.

The Chief answered, he should do as he pleased, but it was against his
Judgment to attack a Town which Nature her self had fortified, which God
Almighty would never suffer to be taken, and which had, to no Purpose,
cost the Lives of a Number scarce to be told, of his Countrymen, in the
several Attempts they had made to be Masters of it.

_North_ disposed his Army, and invested the Rock on every Side, then
sent Word to the Town, if they did not surrender he would give no
Quarter to either Sex or Age. The Inhabitants laugh'd at his Message,
told him, they did not believe he had learnt the Art of flying, and till
he had, they thought themselves very secure from his putting such
Menaces in Execution.

Out of the White Men, _North_ chose 30, whom he set at the Head of 3
Companies, consisting of 100 Blacks each; and as he had some
Grenade-Shells with 'em, soon dispersed the Guard at the Foot of the
Rock, and made a Lodgment; tho' the Blacks were acquainted with
Fire-Arms, the Shells were entirely new to them, and as they saw their
terrible Effect, threw down their Arms, and gained the Middle of the
Rock, where they had another _Corps de Guarde_, tho' not without some
Loss. Those who were at the Bottom of the Rock being put to flight,
_North_ sent 10 Whites and 500 Blacks to take that Post, and Orders to
the other Whites to mount the Rock, and having beat that Guard, if
possible, to enter the Town with them. They accordingly ascended in this
Order, as the Road was so narrow, only three could pass on a-breast, and
the Enemy, when within Cast of a Dart, threw down a Shower upon them,
three unarmed Blacks with their Shields march'd before three small Shot
Men, and shelter'd them from the Enemies Weapons; these were followed by
others, with the same Precaution, the White Men being mix'd with those
who thus went up, that is to say, one White Musketeer to two Blacks.

The Enemy seem'd resolute to defend the Pass, but when they had, to no
Purpose, spent a Number of Darts, and had lost some Men by the Shot,
they swiftly took to the Top of the Rock, where, joined with fresh Men
from the Town, they made a Stand and Shew of Resistance; _North_'s Men
followed, and pouring in a Volley, put them into Confusion, which gave
the Assailants an Opportunity to come near enough to throw in their
Shells, half a dozen of which bursting with considerable Damage, and the
Slaughter of several Men, they thought to shelter themselves in the
Town, but the Inhabitants fearing the Enemy's entering with them, shut
the Gates against both, so that the Blacks of _North_'s Army,
notwithstanding all the Whites could do to the contrary, made a great
Slaughter; however, they saved some, whom they sent Prisoners to the
Camp, desiring, at the same Time, a Supply of Powder to make a Petarde.

In the mean while the Enemy from the Town threw a prodigious Quantity of
Darts, which the Besiegers received upon their Shields, at least, the
greater Part.

The Town was again summon'd, but they refus'd to surrender, wherefore,
they were obliged to shelter themselves as well as they could, and
expect the Powder from the Camp; tho' in the mean while, the small Shot
from without being warmly plied, made the throwing Darts from the Town
less frequent, for none could shew his Head but with the greatest
Danger.

When the Powder came, they cut down and hollowed a Tree, which they
filled with Powder, and plugg'd up very tight, and under the Protection
of their Shields and Muskets got it to the Gate, under which they dug a
Hole large enough to receive it, then setting Fire to the Fuze, it burst
with a terrible Crack, tore their Gate to Shatters, and left an open
Passage, which the Besiegers, who had been join'd with 500 more Blacks,
who came up with the Powder, enter'd, and began a very great Slaughter;
the Whites protected all they could who submitted, but notwithstanding
their Diligence, the Town was strew'd with dead and dying Men. At length
what with being tir'd, and what with Persuasion, the Slaughter ceas'd,
the Town was reduced to Ashes, and the Conquerors return'd to the Camp
with 3000 Prisoners, whom his Allies led to their own Quarters, where
calling out, the old Women, Children, and useless Slaves, they sent them
to _North_, as if by these, they thought themselves releas'd from the
Promise made to induce his Assistance.

When _North_ saw the Dishonesty of these People, he sent for their
Prince, and told him, 'According to Agreement all the Slaves belong'd to
him; nay, according to Justice he alone had a Right to them, since he
despair'd of taking the Town, so far as to dissuade his besieging it;
and that he not only owed to him their Success, but even the Safety of
his Army, and all the Plunder they should make in the Prosecution of the
War, for Reasons already given, and by himself allow'd to be good. That
he thought he had allied himself with a People of Integrity, but he was
sorry to say, he found himself quite mistaken in his Opinion, since they
were so far from making good their Treaty; that they sent him out of the
Slaves taken, instead of all, those only whom they knew not what to do
with; that they must not imagine him so blind as not to perceive how
disingenuously he was dealt with; or that he wanted either Strength or
Resolution to resent the Usage.'

He then ask'd what was become of a Number of young and handsome Women he
had seen among the Captives?

The Prince answer'd, 'That those he enquired after were his and his
Countrymens Relations, and as such they could not consent to, nor could
he require their being made Slaves.'

This Answer made, the Chief left him; as it was delivered in a pretty
haughty Tone, it did not a little nettle both _North_ and his Comrades;
the latter were for immediately doing themselves Justice, but the former
begg'd they would have Patience and rely on him; they followed his
Advice, and he sent an Interpreter, who privately enquired among the
Women what Relation they had to the People of the River; the Prisoners
answered, that some of their Forefathers had inter-married with that
Nation.

I must here take Notice, that notwithstanding the Inhabitants of
_Madagascar_ have but one Language which is common to the whole Island,
the Difference of the Dialect in different Nations makes it very
difficult for any but the Natives, or those who have been a great many
Years (more than _North_ and his Companions had been) among them to
understand them perfectly, which is the Reason he made use of an
Interpreter, as well between him and the Chief, as between the Slaves
and him.

When he had received this Answer from the Prisoners, he went to the
Prince, and told him, 'It was very odd he should make War on his
Relations, however, he should keep them since he declared them such,
till he could prove his Right better than the Prince could his Nearness
of Blood; that as he had once taken them, he would try if he could not
support the Justice of his Claim, and bid him therefore be upon his
Guard, for he openly declared, he was no longer the Ally, but the
profess'd Enemy of faithless People.'

Saying this, he and his Blacks separated themselves from the
_Mangorians_, and _North_ divided them into Companies, with his White
Men at the Head of each, and order'd them to fire Ball over the Heads of
their late Allies; the first Volley was a prodigious Astonishment to the
_Mangorians_, several of whom ran away, but _North_ firing two more
immediately, and marching up to them, brought the Prince and the Head
Officers of his Army to him, crawling on all four; they (as the Custom
of shewing the greatest Submission is among them) kiss'd the Feet of the
Whites, and begg'd they would continue their Friendship, and dispose of
every Thing as they thought proper.

_North_ told him, 'Deceit was the Sign of a mean and coward Soul; that
had he, the Prince, thought too considerable, what, however, was justly
his Due, because not only promised to, but taken by him, he ought to
have expostulated with him, _North_, and have told him his Sentiments,
which might have, it was possible, made no Division, for neither he nor
his Men were greedy or unreasonable; but as the Prince had not the
Courage publickly to claim the Slaves, he would have basely stolen them
by false Pretences of Kindred, it was a Sign he did not think such Claim
justifiable, as certainly it was not, for all his Captains could witness
their Prince had agreed the Prisoners taken should be given to the
Whites, and his Companions, a sufficient Title, to mention no other.
That he had resolved to shew them, by a severe Chastisement, the
Abhorrence those of his Colour have to Ingratitude and Deceit, and what
Difference there was in fighting on the Ground of Justice, and the
supporting Wrong and Injury; but as they acknowledg'd their Error, he
should not only forgive but forget what was past, provided no new
Treachery, in his Return, which he resolved upon, refresh'd his Memory.'
He then order'd them to bring all the Slaves, and they punctually
complied without Reply.

_North_ chose out the finest and ablest among them, and dividing the
whole Number of Prisoners into two equal Bands, he kept that in which he
had placed the chosen Slaves, and sent the other to the Prince, telling
him, 'tho' neither Fraud nor Compulsion could wring a Slave from him,
yet Justice, as some of his Troops had shared the Danger, and a generous
Temper, had sent him that Present, which was half the Spoil; tho' he
could not think of going any farther on with the War, that he ought to
content himself with the taking a Town they thought impregnable, and
blame his own Conduct, if he should continue in the Field, and hereafter
find the Want of his Assistance.'

The Prince and his People admired the Penetration, Bravery, and
Generosity of the Whites, and sent them Word, 'He was more obliged to
them for the Lesson they had taught him by their Practice, than for the
Slaves they had presented him, tho' he esteem'd the Present as he ought.
That for the future he should have an Abhorrence from every mean Action,
since he had learned from them the Beauty of a candid open Procedure. At
the same Time he thank'd him for the Present, and the not suffering his
Resentment to go farther than the frightning him into his Duty; for he
was sensible his Balls were not fir'd over their Heads, but by Orders
proceeding from the Humanity of the Whites, who, he observed, tender
over the Lives of their Enemies, contrary to the Custom of his
Countrymen, who give Quarter to none, the Females and Infants excepted,
that there may hereafter be none to take Revenge; he begg'd, that he
would suffer their Submission to get the better of his Design to
depart.' This could not prevail, the Whites and their Friends, who came
with them, turn'd their Faces towards home, taking their Slaves and
Cattle with them; tho' the _Mangorians_ were sensibly touch'd at the
Obstinacy of _North_'s Resolution, yet they parted very amicably.

As the Whites were returning home with their Company, they fell in with
another Nation, the _Timouses_, whose Prince join'd _North_, with 500
Men, and swore a strict Amity with him and his Crew.

The Ceremony used among the Natives, as it is uncommon, so an Account of
it may, perhaps, be agreeable to my Readers. The Parties, who swear to
each other, interweave their Toes and Fingers, so that they must
necessarily sit very close to each other. When they have thus knit their
Hands and Feet, they reciprocally swear to do each other all friendly
Offices, to be a Friend or Enemy to the Friend or Enemy of the Party to
whom they swear; and if they falsify the Oath they make, they imprecate
several Curses on themselves, as may they fall by the Lance, be devoured
by the Alligator, or struck dead by the Hand of God; then an Assistant
scarifies each of the contracting Parties on the Chest, and wiping up
the Blood with a Piece of Bread, gives this bloody Bread to each of them
to eat, that is, each eats the Blood of the other; and this Oath whether
it be with equal Parties, or with a Prince and his Subject, where the
one promises Protection, and the other Obedience (which was the Nature
of that taken between _North_ and this Prince) is look'd upon
inviolable, and they have few Examples of its being broken; but where
any has been wicked enough to violate this solemn Oath, they say, they
have been ever punish'd according to their Imprecations.

As this Prince had War with powerful Neighbours, he left his Country,
taking with him all his great Men, Wives, and Relations, and with a
Company of about 500 fighting Men, followed _North_, and settled by him,
where he staid two Years, the Time _North_ staid; during this Space,
being supplied with Arms, Powder, and several Natives by Captain
_North_, he made several Inroads into his Enemies Countries, and made
all he conquer'd, swear Allegiance to Capt. _North_.

At the Expiration of two Years, Captain _Halsey_ came in with a
Brigantine, as is said in the Life of Captain _White_.

This Crew having made a broken Voyage were discontented with their
Captain, and desired _North_ to take the Command upon him; but he
declined it, saying, _Halsey_ was every Way as capable, and that they
ought not to depose a Man, whom they could not tax with either Want of
Courage or Conduct; and for his Part, he would never take the Command
from any who did not justly merit to be turn'd out, which was not
_Halsey_'s Case.

The Crew were not, however, satisfied, and they made the same Offer to
_White_, but by _North_'s Industry, they were, at last, prevail'd on to
continue their old Commander; and as _North_ and his Companions had
expended their Money in the settling their Plantations, and wanted
Cloaths, the former, therefore, accepted of the Quarter-Master's Post
under _Halsey_, and the others went in the Capacity of private Gentlemen
Adventurers, I mean plain foremast Men, as may be gathered in the Life
of that Pyrate, to which I refer for an Account of the Expedition they
made in the _Red Seas_, beginning at Page 113. Captain _Halsey_ on board
a Prize left _North_ to command the Brigantine they set out in.

The two Commanders were separated by a Storm, but both made for
_Madagascar_; _Halsey_ got to _Ambonavoula_, but _North_ fell in with
_Maratan_, where, finding the Brigantine was very much worm eaten, and
made a great Deal of Water, with one Consent they took ashore all their
Goods, and laid up their Vessel.

They were all very well received; the King being then at War with his
Brother, _North_ prevail'd on his Majesty's Sister to pass her solitary
Hours with him; at the King's Return, having defeated his Brother, he
was very much incens'd against _North_, for being so free with the Royal
Family, and resolved to fine him 200 Sequins for the Affront done to his
illustrious House; but _North_ having some Inkling of his Design,
pacified him, by making a Present of one hundred.

The Pyrates continued here a whole Year, when being desirous to go to
_Ambonavoula_, they ask'd the King's Assistance to build a Boat, and he
for 1000 Dollars, set Negroes to work, under the Directions of Captain
_North_, and a Vessel of 15 Tons was set up and launch'd with great
Dispatch.

In this Boat they went to a River, called _Manangaro_, thirty Leagues to
the Northward of _Maratan_: Here some of their Comrades came to them in
a Boat belonging to the _Scotch_ Ship _Neptune_, and help'd to transport
their Goods to _Ambonavoula_, where he had before settled, and had a
Woman and three Children.

He had not been long return'd before his neighbouring Natives reported,
that the _Timouses_, who had followed him from the Southward, had a
Design to rebel against, and murder him and the other Whites, which
giving too easy Credit to, he made War upon, and drove these poor People
out of the Country.

Some Time after he built a Sloop, and went to _Antonguil_, where he
purchas'd 90 Slaves, and took in the _Scots_ Supercargo, Mr. _George
Crookshank_, with a Design to carry him to _Mascarenas_; but all his
Comrades were against it, saying, when he got to _Europe_ he would prove
their Destruction. _North_ answered, nothing could be more cruel, after
they had taken the greater Part of what the poor Gentleman had, than to
keep him from his Country, Family, and Friends; for his Part were he his
Prisoner, he should not ask their Consents in doing an Act of Humanity,
and the only one they were able towards making him some Reparation,
since they could not return his Goods, which were parcel'd out into so
many Shares.

On _North_'s saying thus much, they put the Affair in Question to the
Vote, and there being many who had Obligations to _North_, and whom he
influenced in Favour of the Supercargo, 48 out of 54 voted for the
discharging him. _North_ having gained this Point, the Pyrates ask'd if
he also designed to take with him one _J. B._ a great Favourite of his,
who had been Midship Man on board the _Neptune_ (a young _Scotch_ Man,
who was a good Artist, a thorough Seaman, and very capable of taking on
him the Command in any Voyage) he answered there was a Necessity of
taking him, since he should want his Assistance in the Voyage; as he
depended on his Knowledge, his Companions said _J. B._ would certainly
give him the Slip, which would be a Loss to them all, as he was an
Artist, and a clean hail young Fellow, and therefore his being detained
was necessary to their common Good. To this _North_ answered, his own
Security would oblige his taking Care that he should not get from him,
since no other on board was capable to find the Way back to
_Ambonavoula_.

He went to _Mascarenas_, where the Supercargo and his Negroe were put on
Shore with all the Money he had, which was about 1600 Dollars; for when
the Pyrates made Prize of the _Neptune_, in the Manner already said,
they took none of the Money, they themselves had before paid for
Liquors, _&c._ either from the Captain, Supercargo, or any other on
board; for that, they look'd upon it a base, as well as dishonest
Action, but for the Ship and remaining Part of the Cargo, they had a
fair Title to, _viz._ they wanted both. It is true, they made the
Merchants of the _Greyhound_ refund what Money they had taken; but
before the Reader taxes them with Injustice, and acting against the
above Maxim, let him consider Circumstances, and call to Mind the whole
Story.

They did not take that Ship, on the contrary, they sent her away well
victualled, and provided with Necessaries for her Voyage; and, I hope,
it will be allow'd, they had a lawful Claim to her, as she belong'd to
an Enemy, and came into a Port of theirs, without a Pass: Again, they
did not rob these Merchants of the Money they had before laid out with
them, but took it in Payment for the Liquors they had put on board the
_Greyhound_, out of the _Neptune_, which the Merchants themselves, if
they had any Honesty, could not expect for nothing: But let us suppose
they had taken this Money by Force, and not traded for it on the fair
Foot, as its evident they did; yet, was it no more than an Act of
Justice, such as might reasonably be expected from the Probity of these
Gentlemen, who never suffer an ill Action to go unpunished: And no Body
can justify the Proceedings of those Merchants who advised the seizing
the _Scots_ Ship. But to return.

_North_ would not suffer _J. B._ to go ashore; however, to make him
amends for his Confinement, he gave him four Negroes, whom he sold for
300 Dollars, and took Care that he should live plentifully and well on
board. _North_'s Business, at this Island, was to get Leave to carry his
Children there to be educated in the Christian Faith, which after some
rich Presents made the Governor, he obtained, and return'd to
_Madagascar_. In the Voyage, as _J. B._ was very greatly in his Favour,
and his Confident, he told him, his Design was to leave his Children at
_Mascarenas_, and place Fortunes for them in the Hands of some honest
Priest, who would give them a Christian Education (for he thought it
better to have them Papists, than not Christians) and would then go back
to _Maratan_, and endeavour, by his Penitence, to make Attonement for
his former Life, and never more go off the Island on any Account; that
he would give his Sloop to _J. B._ with two hundred Dollars, that he
might find some Means to return home, since he very wisely refus'd to
join with the Pyrates.

When he came on the _Madagascar_ Coast, he heard a _French_ Ship had
touch'd there, and left some Men behind her; upon which Account, _North_
ran to the Southward 100 Leagues out of his Way, to enquire after and
assist these People: A Piece of Humanity which ought not to be pass'd by
in Silence, for it may shame not a few among us who carry a Face of
Religion, and act with greater Barbarity than those whom we hunt and
destroy as a Nusance to the World, and a Scandal to the Name of Man. If
any thinks this Reflection severe, let him examine into the Number of
Thousands who are perishing in Goals, by the Cruelty of Creditors,
sensible of their Inability to pay: Let him take a View of the Miseries
which reign in those Tombs of the Living, let him enquire into the
Number of those who are yearly starved to Death, to gratify an
implacable Spirit, and then, if he can, clear the _English_ Laws, which
allow a Creditor to punish an unfortunate Man, for his being so, with
the most cruel of all invented Deaths, that of Famine; let him, I say,
clear them from the Imputation of Barbarity. I beg Pardon for this
Digression, which my Concern for the _English_ Character, for this only
Reason sunk among Foreigners forced me into.

_North_ found but one Man, whom he took home with him, cloathed and
maintained him. When he came back to _Ambonavoula_, he found the Country
all in an Uproar, and the Rest of his Companions preparing for a War
with the Natives, but his Arrival restor'd their former Quiet. After
four Months Stay at home, he fitted his Sloop to go out and purchase
Slaves at _Antonguil_; but finding few there to his Mind, for in two
Months he bought but forty, he return'd to his Settlement. He design'd
now to carry his Children to _Mascarenas_, but dissuaded on Account of
the Season, by _J. B._ he went to _Methelage_ on the West Side of the
Island, to trade for Samsams.

Having purchas'd a considerable Quantity of Samsams he went to
_Johanna_, and thence to _Mayotta_, return'd again to _Madagascar_, but
not being able to get round the North End, on Account of the Current, he
put for _Mayotta_ again; on the West Side of this Island put into a
Port, called _Sorez_, where, some Time before, came a Ship from
_England_ to trade, commanded by one _Price_, who going ashore with his
Doctor was detained (as was also his Boat's Crew) till he redeem'd
himself and Surgeon, with 200 Barrels of Powder and 1000 Small Arms; but
was forced to leave his Boat's Crew, not having wherewithal to ransom
them, tho' the Demand was only two Small Arms for each Man. These poor
Creatures were afterwards sold to the _Arabians_; in Revenge _North_ and
his Crew landed, burnt a large Town, and did all the Damage they could.
From _Mayotta_ he went again to _Madagascar_, where a King of his
Acquaintance told him, the Whites and Natives were at War at
_Ambonavoula_; he bought thirty Slaves, refreshed his Crew, and went
home. On the News of his Arrival the Natives sent to conclude a Peace,
but he would not listen to them; on the contrary, rais'd an Army, burnt
a Number of Towns, and took a great many Prisoners.

This Success brought the Natives to sue in a very humble Manner for a
Cessation of Arms, that a general Peace might follow: This he agreed to
about four Months after his Arrival.

His Enemies, having now the Opportunity, corrupted some of his
neighbouring Natives, and in the Night surprized and murder'd him in his
Bed. His Comrades, however, being alarmed, took to their Arms, drove the
treacherous Multitude before them with great Slaughter; and to revenge
_North_'s Death continued the War seven Years, in which Time they became
Masters of all the Country round, and drove out all who did not swear
Allegiance to them.

_North_ had his Will lying by him, which directed _J. B._ to carry his
Children to _Mascarenas_, in his Sloop which he left to the said _J. B._
who was at the Charge to fit her up, and laid out the greater Part of
the Money _North_ bequeathed him; but the Pyrates would not suffer him
to stir while the Wars lasted, fearing he would not return, having never
join'd them in any Pyracies; and therefore, by one Consent, setting Fire
to the Sloop, they detained him several Years, if he is not still there.

                          Transcriber's Notes


The original text had in four places white spaces of the size of
approximately one word, left out for unknown reasons. These have been
marked by "......".

On page 289, the name of Mary Stead appears instead of Anne Bonny. This
has been preserved as in the original.

On page 308, George Bendal is erroneously listed twice in a list of nine
men, making it ten names in total. This has remained uncorrected.

On page 337, an opening bracket is never closed.

The original spelling was mostly preserved. A few obvious typographical
errors were silently corrected. Further careful corrections are listed
here (before/after):

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
